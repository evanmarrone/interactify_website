This document describes how the Petal Perks Program (“Petal Perks” or the “Program”) works and is an agreement between you, the person to whom the Petal 1 Card was issued (“Accountholder” or “you”) and WebBank. You agree that your use of the Petal 1 Credit Card or any feature of this Program constitutes your acceptance of these Rules.<br/><br/><strong>Program Overview</strong> As a Petal 1 Card Accountholder, you are automatically enrolled in the Petal Perks Program and will earn cash back points (“Cash Back Points”), which you can then redeem for a statement credit, ACH transfer, or a check. Cash Back Points can be earned by meeting the requirements of Qualifying Transactions (also referred to as “Petal Offers”) as described below.<br/><br/><strong>Participation. </strong>The Program and its benefits are offered at our sole discretion and to fully participate you must be an Accountholder in Good Standing. Your Card Account is in “<strong>Good Standing</strong>” as long as you fully comply with these Program Rules, your Petal 1 Visa Credit Card Cardholder Agreement as may be amended from time to time(“Cardholder Agreement”), disclosures agreed to as part of opening your Petal 1 Card(including, as applicable, the Privacy Policies, Truth in Lending Disclosure, and Risk-Based Pricing Disclosure) and Arbitration Agreement (collectively, the “Program Agreements”). At any time your Card Account is not in Good Standing, we may in our sole discretion permit you to make transactions, temporarily suspend your ability to make transactions, or close your account. If your account is not in Good Standing and we permit you to make a transaction(s), you will continue to earn Cash Back Points; however, you will not be able to redeem any Available Cash Back Points until your CardAccount returns to Good Standing. If your account is not in Good Standing and we temporarily suspend your ability to make a transaction(s), you will not earn Cash BackPoints and you will not be able to redeem any Available Cash Back Points until your Card Account returns to Good Standing. If your Card Account is closed by us because it is not in Good Standing or for any other reason you will forfeit any unredeemed Available Cash Back Points. If your Card Account is closed by you for any reason, you will forfeit any unredeemed Available Cash Back Points.<br/><br/>‍<em>Our failure or delay in enforcing any of your obligations, or exercising a right or remedy, does not amount to a waiver of that obligation, right or remedy. Additionally, if we waive a particular obligation in one circumstance, it does not prevent us from subsequently requiring compliance with the obligation on other occasions.<br/><br/>‍</em>We reserve the right to remove any participant from the Program in the event of suspected fraud or abuse in connection with the Program Agreements.<br/><br/><strong>When and how you earn Cash Back Points.<br/><br/><em>Petal Offers</em></strong><em><br/><br/>‍</em>You will automatically be enrolled in Petal Offers, which are merchant-specific deals delivered through your account (each, an “Offer”). You will earn Cash Back Points for Qualifying Transactions, which are defined as transactions that satisfy all requirements specified in the terms of the individual Offers (“Offer Terms”) and this Agreement. The amount of Cash Back Points earned on Qualifying Transactions as well as any additional terms and conditions of the Offer will be presented in the Offer Terms<br/><br/>Petal Offers providesyou with the benefit of receiving discounts with participating merchants on purchasesmade using your Petal 1 Card. We use a third-party card-linked offer provider,DOSH Holdings LLC (“DOSH”), as our service provider to help us operate Petal Offers. As acardholder enrolled in Petal Offers, you authorize us,DOSH, participating merchants and Visa U.S.A(“Visa”) to use and share transaction details related to your Petal 1 Card inconnection with providing you with discounts, credits and other servicesrelated to Petal Offers.

If the Qualifying Transactions is subject to finance charges, such charges may accrue on the total amount of the Qualifying Transactions prior to the application of any statement of credit, and the balance upon which such charges are assessed may include the gross amount of your Qualifying Transaction, from the date such transaction was made (i.e., without any savings from the Offer being applied). You will be responsible to pay amounts due as provided in the terms of your Petal 1 Visa  Credit Card Cardholder Agreement.<br/><br/>‍<em>Foreign Currency Transactions. </em>You can also benefit from Offers while traveling.

You acknowledge that Visa may be unable to monitor every transaction made with a Petal 1 Card which has been enrolled in Petal Offers, including but not limited to payments made through other payment methods(such as a digital wallet or a third party payment app, where you may choose your Petal 1 Card as a funding source but you do not present your card directly to the merchant), payments of existing balances, balance transfers, or transactions that are not processed or submitted through the Visa payment system, and that these transactions are not eligible for Petal Offers.<br/><br/><strong>When and how you can use your Cash Back Points. </strong>Cash Back Points earned during a billing period become available for redemption during the following billing period when they are added to your available Cash Back Points balance (“Available Cash Back Points”) or may be displayed as your “Cash Back Wallet.” We may round the amount of Cash Back Points earned from Qualifying Transactions up or down in a manner determined in our sole discretion. For any given billing period, the amount of Cash Back Points added to your balance is based on the net dollar amount of Qualifying Transactions made during the previous billing period. If the net dollar amount of your Qualifying Transactions  is negative for a billing period, Cash Back Points will be deducted from your Available Cash Back Points/Cash Back Wallet and may result in a negative Available Cash Back balance/Cash Back Wallet.
