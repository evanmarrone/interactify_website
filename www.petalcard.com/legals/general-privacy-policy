Information for Internet-Based Ads (including Personal Information) may be provided to us by a user, or derived from the usage patterns of particular users on the Petal Services and/or services of Third Party Service Providers. Such information may be gathered through tracking users’ activities across time and unaffiliated properties. To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver a pixel (known as a “web beacon”) from a digital marketing partner to you through the Petal Services. Web beacons allow our digital marketing partners to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable our digital marketing partners to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites, and to view, edit or set their own cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.<br/><br/>We do not provide Personal Information to any digital marketing partners for use outside of the Petal Services. We may use analytics service providers to analyze how you interact and engage with the Petal Services and our advertisements, so we can learn and make enhancements to offer you a better experience. Some of these entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Petal Services and other websites, which may include tracking activity across time and unaffiliated properties, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. Information from analytics service providers may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests in the Petal Services and other websites and better understand your online activity. For example, Google, Inc. (“Google”) uses cookies in connection with its Google Analytics services. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Petal Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You have the option to opt out of Google&#x27;s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</a> or the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>.<br/><br/>To the extent that Petal engages in any Interest-Based Advertising, more information can be found here <a href="http://petalcard.com/privacy-policy/interest-based-advertising">petalcard.com/privacy-policy/interest-based-advertising</a>.<br/><br/>Through the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites. To make choices about Interest-Based Ads from participating third parties, including to opt out of receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from participating organizations, please visit the DAA’s or NAI’s consumer opt out pages, which are located at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a> and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>, respectively.</p><p><strong>Aggregate and De-identified Information:</strong></p><p>We collect statistical information about both unregistered and registered users that is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, your Account or your web browser (“Aggregate and De-identified Information”).

This may involve publishing findings or combining Aggregate and De-identified Information with other data sets, but such information will not be shared in a way that allows you or any other person to be personally identified.</p><p><strong>How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?</strong></p><p>Information Disclosed for Our Everyday Business Purposes</p><p>We share information about you for our everyday business purposes, such as to process your application, assist in underwriting, process your transactions, maintain your account(s), respond to court orders and legal investigations, or report to credit bureaus.<br/></p><p>Information Disclosed for Petal Offers:</p><p>If you are enrolled in Petal Offers, we may provide Transaction Data and other information to DOSH, the payment card networks, merchants and other partners for use in connection with the program.

This section explains how Petal may collect, use, and disclose personal information subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act (together, the “CCPA”). It also describes the privacy rights of California residents under the CCPA and how they can exercise those rights.This section applies solely to California residents and supplements any other privacy policies or notices applicable to Petal’s Website, Services, or products that you visit or use.</p><p><strong><em>What Personal Information is Covered by the CCPA? </em></strong></p><p>Under the CCPA “personal information” is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular California consumer/resident or household.  Personal information does not include publicly available information, or lawfully obtained, truthful information that is a matter of public concern, information that has been de-identified, aggregate consumer information, or information that does not fall within the definition of personal information above.</p><p>The CCPA does not apply to certain information that is already regulated by federal or state privacy laws, such as information subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and certain other state or federal privacy laws. For example, this California Privacy Rights section does not apply to information that we collect about individuals who seek, apply for, or obtain our financial products and services for personal, family, or household purposes, which is subject to our U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice, or other financial privacy notice applicable to the Petal Website, Services, or products that you visit or use. As such, most of the personal information about you that we may collect and use is protected by the privacy rules of the GLBA and exempt from the CCPA, with potentially only a relatively small dataset of personal information being subject to the CCPA. Please note that the disclosures below may pertain to information that is regulated by GLBA, FCRA, or other laws, and Petal does not waive any applicable CCPA exemptions as to that information by including such disclosures in this Privacy Policy. </p><p>Similarly, this section does not apply to information we collect in the context of a person’s role as a job applicant, employee, associate, contractor, or other member of Petal’s workforce, which is subject to Petal’s California Employment Information Privacy Statement.

The categories of personal information that we collect, use, and disclose about a California resident will depend on our specific relationship or interaction with that individual.
