UNLESS YOU ARE A “COVERED BORROWER” PROTECTED BY THE MILITARY LENDING ACT (THE “MLA”) OR UNLESS YOU PROMPTLY REJECT THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE, IT WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT ON YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS PROCEEDING.<br/><br/>This Agreement governs the Petal 2 VISA® credit card account (“Account”) and related credit card (“Card”) provided by WebBank, located in Salt Lake City, Utah (the “Bank”). This Agreement includes the Important Disclosures we provided to you after approving you for the Account (the “Customized Disclosures”), the Arbitration Clause attached as Exhibit A, the Billing Error Rights Notice attached as Exhibit B, the State Notices attached as Exhibit C, your credit card application, and, as applicable, the Privacy Policy, and Risk-Based Pricing Disclosure. In this Agreement, the words “we,” “us,” and “our” mean the Bank, its successors and assigns, and, for purposes of the Arbitration Clause, the Related Parties identified in the Arbitration Clause. The words “you,” “your”, “yours” and “Cardholder” mean the person who applied for, received and accepted the Account from the Bank.<br/><br/><strong>1. Accepting this Agreement.</strong> This Agreement becomes effective and legally binding when you activate your Card by following the instructions on the Activation page of www.petalcard.com or a Petal mobile application (“Petal Website”). You and we agree to comply with, and be bound by, this entire Agreement. You should retain and carefully review this entire Agreement, and sign your Card before using it. By completing your application for the Account (and unless you promptly reject the Arbitration Clause or are a “covered borrower” protected by the Military Lending Act), you agree to the Arbitration Clause even if you do not use the Account or the Card.<br/><br/><strong>2. Purchases</strong>. You may use your Account to purchase or lease goods or services (each, a “purchase”) by presenting your Card or providing to participating merchants and establishments that honor the Card your Card number and additional information by any other means (for example, over the phone, online or through a mobile app). We will not be liable to you (or anyone else) if any merchant or other person cannot or will not process a purchase permitted under this Agreement. Unless prohibited by applicable law, we may from time to time limit the type, number and dollar amount of any purchase, including any cash-like transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit to complete the purchase. Cash-like transactions include, but are not limited to, the following transactions to the extent they are accepted:</p><p>• purchasing travelers checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers, cryptocurrency, other similar digital or virtual currency and other similar transactions;</p><p>• purchasing lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers, and similar offline and online betting transactions;</p><p>• person-to-person money transfers and account-funding transactions that transfer currency; and</p><p>• making a payment using a third party service including bill payment transactions not made directly with the merchant or their service provider.</p><p>We reserve the right to deny any purchase for any reason, such as account default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling, or any indication of increased risk related to the purchase. We may terminate or suspend your use of the Card or the Account, with or without notice to you before or at the time we take such action. Cash advances and balance transfers are not available under this Agreement.<br/><br/><strong>3. Prohibited Uses of Account.</strong> You agree that you will only use the Account for personal, family and household purposes and will not use the Account for any unlawful purpose or for the purpose of paying us on this or any other form of credit account you may have with us. If you use your Card for any such purpose, we may declare you to be in default under this Agreement and we may block such transactions and/or terminate your Account, but you still will be liable to us for all charges relating to such transactions and all other transactions on your Account at the time it is closed. Further, you agree that you will not allow any other person to use the Card or Account without our consent. However, your breach of any of these promises will not affect or limit your liability to us with respect to your purchases. If you authorize or allow any person to use your Account, such authorization will be deemed to extend to all purchases by such person, even if not intended by you, and will continue until you have taken all steps necessary to prevent any further use of the Account by such person, even if you have advised us that such person is no longer authorized to use the Account. <br/><br/><strong>4. Promise to Pay  You promise to pay us for all amounts charged to the Account, including all purchases, interest, and charges charged to your Account.  You are obligated to repay us for all transactions made using your Card by people you have authorized to use the Card even if their use of the Card exceeds the authorization which you gave them.</strong><br/><br/><strong>5. Credit Limit; Available Credit. </strong><br/><br/>(a) We have disclosed your initial credit limit in your approval email. We will disclose your then-current credit limit and available credit on each monthly statement we send you. We may increase or decrease your credit limit at any time, on our own initiative or at your request (if we accept such requests). We may also close your Account or suspend your ability to use the Account at any time. We will provide any notice required by applicable law if we take any adverse action on your Account.<br/><br/>(b) At any time, your available credit equals the excess (if any) of your credit limit over your outstanding Account balance (including principal, and interest charges).  You agree not to attempt any purchase that exceeds your available credit. For purposes of determining your available credit, we do not give effect to any payment prior to the time we determine that the payment has been made with sufficient funds. Depending on your payment method, this may take up to 20 days.  We are not required to approve any purchase if the amount of the purchase exceeds your available credit but we may authorize and pay any such purchase in our absolute discretion. Whenever the outstanding balance of the Account exceeds your credit limit, you agree to pay us the difference on demand unless and to the extent that we have reduced your credit limit below your pre-existing balance prior to the reduction.<br/><br/><strong>6. Monthly Statements.</strong> We will send you a monthly statement shortly after the end of each monthly billing cycle with any activity, fee or interest charge or an ending debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00. However, we are not obligated to send you a monthly statement if we deem your Account to be uncollectible or applicable law does not require us to send you a monthly statement for other reasons. Your monthly statements will show, among other matters, the outstanding balance at the start and end of the billing cycle (that is, the “previous balance” and “new balance,” respectively); purchases; payments, credits and adjustments; interest charges and fees; your credit limit and available credit; and the minimum payment due and payment due date. <br/><br/><strong>7. Interest Charges.<br/><br/>‍</strong>(a) <em>General</em>. We use the “average daily balance (including new purchases)” method to calculate your interest charges. This means that, each billing cycle, we determine your interest charges by multiplying the average daily balance (which is shown on your monthly statements as the “balance subject to interest rate”) times the daily periodic rate and then by multiplying this amount by the number of days in the billing cycle.<br/><br/>(b) <em>Grace Period on Purchases</em>. <br/><br/>(i) If your Account balance is $0 at the beginning of a billing cycle or you pay the entire Account balance as of the beginning of a billing cycle by the payment due date that falls in such billing cycle, you get a “grace period” and will not be charged any interest charges for such billing cycle.<br/><br/>(ii) If you do not get a grace period for a billing cycle but you got a grace period for the immediately preceding billing cycle, we will not charge interest charges on purchases that were outstanding during such preceding billing cycle to the extent such purchases are paid by the payment due date that falls in the current billing cycle.<br/><br/>(iii) If you get a grace period on purchases for a billing cycle on account of a payment that is dishonored or reversed in the next billing cycle or a credit that is reversed in the next billing cycle due to the resolution of a billing dispute, we will charge you in the next billing cycle the interest charges you avoided in the prior billing cycle due to the dishonored or reversed payment or credit.<br/><br/> (c) <em>Interest Rates</em>. <br/><br/>(i) The daily periodic rate equals the APR divided by 365, rounded to the 6th decimal place.<br/><br/>(ii) The APR each billing cycle equals the sum of the Margin shown on your Customized Disclosures and the WSJ Prime Rate, determined as of the second business day (not weekends or federal holidays) of the same month in which your billing cycle closes (the “Determination Date”).  Accordingly, the APR (and daily periodic rate) may vary each billing cycle. The “WSJ Prime Rate” is the highest U.S. Prime Rate as published in the “Money Rates” section of <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> on the Determination Date (or if <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>does not publish such rate on such day, the latest prior day it does publish such rate). (If <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> stops publishing the U.S. Prime Rate in its “Money Rates” section, then we may substitute another index and margin, in our sole discretion, subject to applicable law.) An increase or decrease in the WSJ Prime Rate will cause a corresponding increase or decrease in the variable APR. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the APR and daily periodic rate will never exceed the maximum rates permitted by applicable law. <br/><br/>(iii) Unless you qualify for a grace period (see subsection (b)), if and when the variable APR increases, more interest charges will accrue. This will result in higher and/or more payments if you pay the minimum payment due each month. Unless you qualify for a grace period, if and when the variable APR decreases, less interest charges will accrue. This will result in lower and/or fewer payments if you pay the minimum payment due each month.<br/><br/>(d) <em>Balances Subject to Interest Rate</em>. <br/><br/>(i) The average daily balance (also known as the balance subject to interest rate) equals the sum of the closing daily Account balances for each day of the billing cycle, divided by the number of days in the billing cycle. <br/><br/>(ii) If you get a grace period for a billing cycle (see subsection (b)(i)), the Account balance is treated as $0 for each day in the billing cycle (and the average daily balance is $0). Otherwise, the closing balance for each day in the billing cycle is computed as follows: <br/><br/>(A) For each day (including the first day of the billing cycle), we start with the prior day’s closing balance, if any. <br/><br/>(B) For the first day of the billing cycle, if you received a grace period for the immediately preceding billing cycle, we deduct all payments and credits applied to purchases and posted by the payment due date that falls within the current billing cycle.<br/><br/>(C) For each day in the billing cycle (including the first day of the billing cycle), we add any new purchases posted to your Account, we add the interest charges from the prior day (the prior day’s closing balance times the daily periodic rate) and subtract any payments or credits. However, we do not subtract a second time any payments or credits that have already been subtracted in step (B) above. (This method results in the daily compounding of interest charges.)<br/><br/>(D) We treat any negative daily balance as $0.<br/><br/>(e) <em>Interest Accrual Periods</em>. We charge interest charges over the following periods:<br/><br/>(i) If you get a grace period for the billing cycle in which the purchase is posted to the Account (the “Purchase Cycle”) and for the next billing cycle (the “Next Cycle”), we charge no interest charges at all.<br/><br/>(ii) If you get a grace period for the Purchase Cycle but not for the Next Cycle, we charge interest charges from the first day of the Next Cycle through the earlier of: (1) the day the purchase is repaid in full; or (2) the day before the beginning of the first billing cycle that comes after the Next Cycle and for which you get a grace period (the “Interest End Date”).<br/><br/>(iii) If you do not get a grace period for the Purchase Cycle, we charge interest charges from the day the purchase is posted to the Account through the Interest End Date.<br/><br/><strong>8. Fees. </strong>None<br/><br/><strong>9. Limits on Interest and Charges. </strong>It is not our intent to charge or collect any interest,  or charge in excess of the amount permitted by applicable law. If any interest, or charge is finally determined to be in excess of the amount permitted by applicable law, we will credit the excess amount against the outstanding balance in your Account or refund it to you.<br/><br/><strong>10. Payments. <br/><br/>‍</strong>(a) Each month, you must pay at least the minimum payment due shown on your monthly statement by the “cut-off time” on the payment due date shown on your monthly statement. The payment due date will be at least 25 days after the date of the monthly statement and will typically be on the same day of each calendar month. However, if the payment due date falls on a day we do not receive mail (a “non-business day”), we will not treat your payment by mail as late for any purpose if we receive it by the cut-off time on the next day we receive mail (a “business day”). The “cut-off time” is 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time for payments made online through the Petal Website or over the phone or 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time if you mail-in a payment by check or money order.<br/><br/>(b) If the new balance shown on your monthly statement for a billing cycle (the “Statement Cycle”) is less than $25.00, the minimum payment due in the next billing cycle equals such new balance. </p><p>Otherwise, the minimum payment due equals:</p><p>       • Any amount past due at the end of the Statement Cycle; plus</p><p>       • The greater of: </p><p>          (i)$25.00; or </p><p>          (ii) 1% of such new balance (excluding any interest charges and any amount past due), plus interest charges for the Statement Cycle.<br/><br/>(c) You agree to make all payments in U.S. dollars in accordance with our instructions online on the Petal Website, by phone or by a check or money order drawn on a financial institution located in the U.S. All payments by check or money order must be mailed or delivered to us at the payment address shown on the front of your monthly statement. We reserve the right to refuse any non-conforming payments. Any payments received after the cut-off time on a business day or received on a non-business day will be credited on the next business day. However, credit to your Account may be delayed for up to five days if we accept a check or money order that is not:(i) received by mail or messenger service at the payment address on your monthly statement; or (ii) accompanied by the top portion of your monthly statement. Delayed crediting or our refusal of your non-conforming payment may cause you to incur additional interest charges, subject to applicable law.<br/><br/>(d) Subject to applicable law, we may apply payments and other credits to your Account in any manner we choose in our sole discretion.  We will usually apply the minimum payment first to interest charges and then to balances. Although your minimum payment will be applied in any order at our discretion, payments in excess of the minimum payment will be applied to balances with the highest APR first and then to lower rate balances in descending order of APR. This means that balances with higher APRs are reduced before balances with lower APRs for any amount of your payment that is in excess of your minimum payment due. <br/><br/>(e) All credits for payments to your Card are subject to final payment by the institution on which the payment item was drawn. Depending upon the type of payment you make, your available credit may not be restored for up to 20 days after we receive a payment.<br/><br/>(f) You agree not to send us payments marked “paid in full,” “without recourse” or with similar language. If you send such a payment, we may accept it without losing any of our rights under this Agreement, including our right to collect the full amount owed by you. All written communications concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes “payment in full” of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, must be mailed or delivered to the Notice Address (as defined in Section 18), Attn: Disputed Payments. <br/><br/><strong>11. Prepayment. At any time, you may pay all or any part of your outstanding Account balance, without penalty.</strong> Payment of more than the minimum payment due in one billing cycle will not relieve you of the obligation to pay the entire minimum payment due in subsequent billing cycles.<br/><br/><strong>12. Termination. </strong>Subject to applicable law, we may suspend, revoke or cancel your Account privileges, your right to use the Card or deny any transaction, in our sole discretion at any time, with or without cause and with or without giving you notice.  Any termination of credit privileges, whether initiated by us or by you, will not affect any of our rights or your obligations under this Agreement, including your obligation to repay any amounts you owe us according to the terms of this Agreement. On our demand or upon termination of credit privileges, you agree to surrender to us or destroy the Card. If you attempt to use the Card after the termination of credit privileges (whether or not we have provided notice of such termination), the Card may be retained by a merchant, ATM or financial institution where you attempt to use the Card.<br/><br/><strong>13. Default.</strong> Subject to applicable law, we may declare you to be in default under this Agreement if: (a) you fail to pay any minimum payment due on or before the payment due date; (b) you attempt to or do exceed your credit limit; (c) you make a payment that is dishonored or reversed; (d) you die or are declared legally or mentally incompetent; (e) a petition is filed or other proceeding is commenced by or against you under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any other federal or state insolvency laws; (f) you become insolvent or unable to pay your debts; (g) you provide us with any false or misleading information; (h) you breach any of your other obligations under this Agreement; (i) you are in default of any other credit agreement you have with us or with Petal (as defined in Section 16); or (j) we have any reason to believe you are unwilling or unable to pay your debts.<br/><br/><strong>Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine and South Carolina Residents Only: </strong>We may declare you to be in default if you fail to make a payment as required by this Agreement (or within 10 days of the time required by this Agreement, for Iowa residents) or if the prospect of your payment or performance is significantly impaired (for Iowa residents, if, following an event of default, the prospect of your payment is materially impaired).  We have the burden of establishing the impairment of such prospect of payment or performance.<br/><br/>‍<strong>Wisconsin Residents:</strong> We may declare you to be in default (a) if you permit to be outstanding an amount exceeding one full payment which has remained unpaid for more than 10 days after its scheduled due date or deferred due date, or if you fail to pay the first payment or last payment within 40 days of its scheduled due date or deferred due date or (b) if you fail to observe any other provision of this Agreement, the breach of which materially impairs your ability to pay the amounts due under the Agreement.<br/><br/>‍<strong>14. Remedies. </strong>In the event of your default under this Agreement, we may, subject to applicable law (including any applicable notice requirement): (a) declare all or any portion of your outstanding Account balance to be immediately due and payable; (b) instead allow you to repay your Account balance by paying the minimum payment due each billing cycle, without waiving any rights under subsection (a); and/or (c) commence a collection action against you and charge you for any court costs and/or any reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs we are charged in connection with such action by any attorney who is not our salaried employee. After a default, interest charges will continue to accrue until your total Account balance, including accrued interest charges, is paid in full, subject to applicable law.<br/><br/>‍<strong>15. Delay in Enforcement.</strong> We may at any time and in our sole discretion delay or waive enforcing any of our rights or remedies under this Agreement or under applicable law without losing any of those or any other rights or remedies. Even if we do not enforce our rights or remedies at any one time, we may enforce them at a later date. For example, we may accept late payments or payments that are marked “payment in full” or with other restrictive endorsements without losing any of our rights under this Agreement. <br/><br/>‍<strong>16. Servicer. </strong>Petal Card, Inc. (“Petal”), along with its partners and service providers, is the servicer of your Account and Card. In that capacity, Petal may act on our behalf, perform our obligations or enforce our rights under this Agreement.<strong><br/><br/>17.

However, to the extent you have the right to revoke your consent to communications by autodialed calls and text messages to your mobile number under applicable law, you may exercise this right by contacting the applicable Messaging Party directly or by sending a request by email to support@petalcard.com with the subject line “END COMMUNICATIONS.” You may opt-out of receiving most of these messages at any time by sending us a request to support@petalcard.com or by responding “STOP” to any text message.
