UNLESS YOU ARE A “COVERED BORROWER” PROTECTED BY THE MILITARY LENDING ACT (THE “MLA”) OR UNLESS YOU PROMPTLY REJECT THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE, IT WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT ON YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS PROCEEDING.<br/><br/>This Agreement governs the Petal 1 VISA® credit card account (“Account”) and related credit card (“Card”) provided by WebBank, located in Salt Lake City, Utah (the “Bank”). This Agreement includes the Important Disclosures we provided to you after approving you for the Account (the “Customized Disclosures”), the Arbitration Clause attached as Exhibit A, the Billing Error Rights Notice attached as Exhibit B, the State Notices attached as Exhibit C, your credit card application, and, as applicable, the Privacy Policy, and Risk-Based Pricing Disclosure. In this Agreement, the words “we,” “us,” and “our” mean the Bank, its successors and assigns, and, for purposes of the Arbitration Clause, the Related Parties identified in the Arbitration Clause. The words “you,” “your”, “yours” and “Cardholder” mean the person who applied for, received and accepted the Account from the Bank.<br/><br/><strong>1. Accepting this Agreement.</strong> This Agreement becomes effective and legally binding when you activate your Card by following the instructions on the Activation page of www.petalcard.com or a Petal mobile application (“Petal Website”). You and we agree to comply with, and be bound by, this entire Agreement. You should retain and carefully review this entire Agreement, and sign your Card before using it. By completing your application for the Account (and unless you promptly reject the arbitration clause or are a “covered borrower” protected by the Military Lending Act), you agree to the Arbitration Clause even if you do not use the Account or the Card.<br/><br/><strong>2. Purchases</strong>. You may use your Account to purchase or lease goods or services (each, a “purchase”) by presenting your Card or providing to participating merchants and establishments that honor the Card your Card number and additional information by any other means (for example, over the phone, online or through a mobile app). We will not be liable to you (or anyone else) if any merchant or other person cannot or will not process a purchase permitted under this Agreement. Unless prohibited by applicable law, we may from time to time limit the type, number and dollar amount of any purchase, including any cash-like transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit to complete the purchase. Cash-like transactions include, but are not limited to, the following transactions to the extent they are accepted:</p><p>• purchasing travelers checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers, cryptocurrency, other similar digital or virtual currency and other similar transactions;</p><p>• purchasing lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers, and similar offline and online betting transactions;</p><p>• person-to-person money transfers and account-funding transactions that transfer currency; and</p><p>• making a payment using a third party service including bill payment transactions not made directly with the merchant or their service provider.</p><p>We reserve the right to deny any purchase for any reason, such as account default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling, or any indication of increased risk related to the purchase. We may terminate or suspend your use of the Card or the Account, with or without notice to you before or at the time we take such action. Cash advances and balance transfers are not available under this Agreement.<br/><br/><strong>3. Prohibited Uses of Account.</strong> You agree that you will only use the Account for personal, family and household purposes and will not use the Account for any unlawful purpose or for the purpose of paying us on this or any other form of credit account you may have with us. If you use your Card for any such purpose, we may declare you to be in default under this Agreement and we may block such transactions and/or terminate your Account, but you still will be liable to us for all charges relating to such transactions and all other transactions on your Account at the time it is closed. Further, you agree that you will not allow any other person to use the Card or Account without our consent. However, your breach of any of these promises will not affect or limit your liability to us with respect to your purchases. If you authorize or allow any person to use your Account, such authorization will be deemed to extend to all purchases by such person, even if not intended by you, and will continue until you have taken all steps necessary to prevent any further use of the Account by such person, even if you have advised us that such person is no longer authorized to use the Account. <br/><br/><strong>4. Promise to Pay  You promise to pay us for all amounts charged to the Account, including all purchases, interest, and charges charged to your Account.  You are obligated to repay us for all transactions made using your Card by people you have authorized to use the Card even if their use of the Card exceeds the authorization which you gave them.</strong><br/><br/><strong>5. Credit Limit; Available Credit. </strong>‍<br/>(a) We have disclosed your initial credit limit in your approval email. We will disclose your then-current credit limit and available credit on each monthly statement we send you. We may increase or decrease your credit limit at any time, on our own initiative or at your request (if we accept such requests). We may also close your Account or suspend your ability to use the Account at any time. We will provide any notice required by applicable law if we take any adverse action on your Account.<br/><br/>(b) At any time, your available credit equals the excess (if any) of your credit limit over your outstanding Account balance (including principal, fees and interest charges).  You agree not to attempt any purchase that exceeds your available credit. For purposes of determining your available credit, we do not give effect to any payment prior to the time we determine that the payment has been made with sufficient funds. Depending on your payment method, this may take up to 20 days.  We are not required to approve any purchase if the amount of the purchase exceeds your available credit but we may authorize and pay any such purchase in our absolute discretion. Whenever the outstanding balance of the Account exceeds your credit limit, you agree to pay us the difference on demand unless and to the extent that we have reduced your credit limit below your pre-existing balance prior to the reduction.<br/><br/><strong>6. Monthly Statements.</strong> We will send you a monthly statement shortly after the end of each monthly billing cycle with any activity, fee or interest charge or an ending debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00. However, we are not obligated to send you a monthly statement if we deem your Account to be uncollectible or applicable law does not require us to send you a monthly statement for other reasons. Your monthly statements will show, among other matters, the outstanding balance at the start and end of the billing cycle (that is, the “previous balance” and “new balance,” respectively); purchases; payments, credits and adjustments; interest charges and fees; your credit limit and available credit; and the minimum payment due and payment due date. <br/><br/><strong>7. Interest Charges.<br/><br/>‍</strong>(a) <em>General</em>. We use the “average daily balance (including new purchases)” method to calculate your interest charges. This means that, each billing cycle, we determine your interest charges by multiplying the average daily balance (which is shown on your monthly statements as the “balance subject to interest rate”) times the daily periodic rate and then by multiplying this amount by the number of days in the billing cycle.<br/><br/>(b) <em>Grace Period on Purchases</em>. <br/><br/>(i) If your Account balance is $0 at the beginning of a billing cycle or you pay the entire Account balance as of the beginning of a billing cycle by the payment due date that falls in such billing cycle, you get a “grace period” and will not be charged any interest charges for such billing cycle.<br/><br/>(ii) If you do not get a grace period for a billing cycle but you got a grace period for the immediately preceding billing cycle, we will not charge interest charges on purchases that were outstanding during such preceding billing cycle to the extent such purchases are paid by the payment due date that falls in the current billing cycle.<br/><br/>(iii) If you get a grace period on purchases for a billing cycle on account of a payment that is dishonored or reversed in the next billing cycle or a credit that is reversed in the next billing cycle due to the resolution of a billing dispute, we will charge you in the next billing cycle the interest charges you avoided in the prior billing cycle due to the dishonored or reversed payment or credit.<br/><br/> (c) <em>Interest Rates</em>. <br/><br/>(i) The daily periodic rate equals the APR divided by 365, rounded to the 6th decimal place.<br/><br/>(ii) The APR each billing cycle equals the sum of the Margin shown on your Customized Disclosures and the WSJ Prime Rate, determined as of the second business day (not weekends or federal holidays) of the same month in which your billing cycle closes (the “Determination Date”).  Accordingly, the APR (and daily periodic rate) may vary each billing cycle. The “WSJ Prime Rate” is the highest U.S. Prime Rate as published in the “Money Rates” section of <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> on the Determination Date (or if <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>does not publish such rate on such day, the latest prior day it does publish such rate). (If <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> stops publishing the U.S. Prime Rate in its “Money Rates” section, then we may substitute another index and margin, in our sole discretion, subject to applicable law.) An increase or decrease in the WSJ Prime Rate will cause a corresponding increase or decrease in the variable APR. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the APR and daily periodic rate will never exceed the maximum rates permitted by applicable law. <br/><br/>(iii) Unless you qualify for a grace period (see subsection (b)), if and when the variable APR increases, more interest charges will accrue. This will result in higher and/or more payments if you pay the minimum payment due each month. Unless you qualify for a grace period, if and when the variable APR decreases, less interest charges will accrue. This will result in lower and/or fewer payments if you pay the minimum payment due each month.<br/><br/>(d) <em>Balances Subject to Interest Rate</em>. <br/><br/>(i) The average daily balance (also known as the balance subject to interest rate) equals the sum of the closing daily Account balances for each day of the billing cycle, divided by the number of days in the billing cycle. <br/><br/>(ii) If you get a grace period for a billing cycle (see subsection (b)(i)), the Account balance is treated as $0 for each day in the billing cycle (and the average daily balance is $0). Otherwise, the closing balance for each day in the billing cycle is computed as follows: <br/><br/>(A) For each day (including the first day of the billing cycle), we start with the prior day’s closing balance, if any. <br/><br/>(B) For the first day of the billing cycle, if you received a grace period for the immediately preceding billing cycle, we deduct all payments and credits applied to purchases and posted by the payment due date that falls within the current billing cycle.<br/><br/>(C) For each day in the billing cycle (including the first day of the billing cycle), we add any new purchases posted to your Account, we add the interest charges from the prior day (the prior day’s closing balance times the daily periodic rate), add any fees charged that day, and subtract any payments or credits. However, we do not subtract a second time any payments or credits that have already been subtracted in step (B) above. (This method results in the daily compounding of interest charges.)<br/><br/>(D) We treat any negative daily balance as $0.<br/><br/>(e) <em>Interest Accrual Periods</em>. We charge interest charges over the following periods:<br/><br/>(i) If you get a grace period for the billing cycle in which the purchase is posted to the Account (the “Purchase Cycle”) and for the next billing cycle (the “Next Cycle”), we charge no interest charges at all.<br/><br/>(ii) If you get a grace period for the Purchase Cycle but not for the Next Cycle, we charge interest charges from the first day of the Next Cycle through the earlier of: (1) the day the purchase is repaid in full; or (2) the day before the beginning of the first billing cycle that comes after the Next Cycle and for which you get a grace period (the “Interest End Date”).<br/><br/>(iii) If you do not get a grace period for the Purchase Cycle, we charge interest charges from the day the purchase is posted to the Account through the Interest End Date.<br/><br/>8. Fees. Subject to applicable law, including the federal Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, you agree to pay the following fees: <br/><br/>(a) <em>Penalty fees</em>. <br/><br/>(i) Each time we do not receive the minimum payment due in full by the payment due date, we will charge you a late fee of $29.00 if we have not charged (or waived) a late fee within the six immediately preceding billing cycles.  However, we will charge a late fee of $40.00 if we have already charged (or waived) a late fee within the six immediately preceding billing cycles. We will never charge a late fee exceeding the minimum payment due that is late. <br/><br/>(ii) Each time a payment on your Account is returned or reversed for any reason or we must return any check or instrument you send us because it is not signed or is otherwise incomplete, we will charge you a returned payment fee of $29.00. However, we will not charge a returned payment fee if we are charging a late fee with respect to the same minimum payment due and will never charge a returned payment fee exceeding the minimum payment due that was due immediately prior to the date on which the payment was returned to us.<br/><br/>(b) <em>Additional fees</em>. We may charge fees for special services you request in accordance with applicable law.<br/><br/><strong>9. Limits on Interest, Fees and Charges. </strong>It is not our intent to charge or collect any interest, fee or charge in excess of the amount permitted by applicable law. If any interest, fee or charge is finally determined to be in excess of the amount permitted by applicable law, we will credit the excess amount against the outstanding balance in your Account or refund it to you.<br/><br/><strong>10. Payments. <br/><br/>‍</strong>(a) Each month, you must pay at least the minimum payment due shown on your monthly statement by the “cut-off time” on the payment due date shown on your monthly statement. The payment due date will be at least 25 days after the date of the monthly statement and will typically be on the same day of each calendar month. However, if the payment due date falls on a day we do not receive mail (a “non-business day”), we will not treat your payment by mail as late for any purpose if we receive it by the cut-off time on the next day we receive mail (a “business day”). The “cut-off time” is 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time for payments made online through the Petal Website or over the phone or 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time if you mail-in a payment by check or money order.<br/><br/>(b) If the new balance shown on your monthly statement for a billing cycle (the“Statement Cycle”) is less than $25.00, the minimum payment due in the next billing cycle equals such new balance. </p><p>Otherwise, the minimum payment due equals:</p><p>    • Any amount past due at the end of the Statement Cycle; plus</p><p>    • The greater of: </p><p>        (i) $25.00; or </p><p>        (ii) 1% of such new balance (excluding any interest charges, late fees, and any amount past due), plus interest charges for the Statement Cycle and any late fees.</p><p><br/>(c) You agree to make all payments in U.S. dollars in accordance with our instructions online on the Petal Website, by phone or by a check or money order drawn on a financial institution located in the U.S. All payments by check or money order must be mailed or delivered to us at the payment address shown on the front of your monthly statement. We reserve the right to refuse any non-conforming payments. Any payments received after the cut-off time on a business day or received on a non-business day will be credited on the next business day. However, credit to your Account may be delayed for up to five days if we accept a check or money order that is not: (i) received by mail or messenger service at the payment address on your monthly statement; or (ii) accompanied by the top portion of your monthly statement. Delayed crediting or our refusal of your non-conforming payment may cause you to incur additional fees and interest charges, subject to applicable law. <br/><br/>(d) Subject to applicable law, we may apply payments and other credits to your Account in any manner we choose in our sole discretion.  We will usually apply the minimum payment first to interest charges and then to balances. Although your minimum payment will be applied in any order at our discretion, payments in excess of the minimum payment will be applied to balances with the highest APR first and then to lower rate balances in descending order of APR. This means that balances with higher APRs are reduced before balances with lower APRs for any amount of your payment that is in excess of your minimum payment due. <br/><br/>(e) All credits for payments to your Card are subject to final payment by the institution on which the payment item was drawn. Depending upon the type of payment you make, your available credit may not be restored for up to 20 days after we receive a payment.<br/><br/>(f) You agree not to send us payments marked “paid in full,” “without recourse” or with similar language. If you send such a payment, we may accept it without losing any of our rights under this Agreement, including our right to collect the full amount owed by you. All written communications concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes “payment in full” of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, must be mailed or delivered to the Notice Address (as defined in Section 18), Attn: Disputed Payments. <br/><br/><strong>11. Prepayment. At any time, you may pay all or any part of your outstanding Account balance, without penalty.</strong> Payment of more than the minimum payment due in one billing cycle will not relieve you of the obligation to pay the entire minimum payment due in subsequent billing cycles.<br/><br/><strong>12. Termination. </strong>Subject to applicable law, we may suspend, revoke or cancel your Account privileges, your right to use the Card or deny any transaction, in our sole discretion at any time, with or without cause and with or without giving you notice.  Any termination of credit privileges, whether initiated by us or by you, will not affect any of our rights or your obligations under this Agreement, including your obligation to repay any amounts you owe us according to the terms of this Agreement. On our demand or upon termination of credit privileges, you agree to surrender to us or destroy the Card. If you attempt to use the Card after the termination of credit privileges (whether or not we have provided notice of such termination), the Card may be retained by a merchant, ATM or financial institution where you attempt to use the Card.<br/><br/><strong>13. Default.</strong> Subject to applicable law, we may declare you to be in default under this Agreement if: (a) you fail to pay any minimum payment due on or before the payment due date; (b) you attempt to or do exceed your credit limit; (c) you make a payment that is dishonored or reversed; (d) you die or are declared legally or mentally incompetent; (e) a petition is filed or other proceeding is commenced by or against you under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any other federal or state insolvency laws; (f) you become insolvent or unable to pay your debts; (g) you provide us with any false or misleading information; (h) you breach any of your other obligations under this Agreement; (i) you are in default of any other credit agreement you have with us or with Petal (as defined in Section 16); or (j) we have any reason to believe you are unwilling or unable to pay your debts.<br/><br/><strong>Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine and South Carolina Residents Only: </strong>We may declare you to be in default if you fail to make a payment as required by this Agreement (or within 10 days of the time required by this Agreement, for Iowa residents) or if the prospect of your payment or performance is significantly impaired (for Iowa residents, if, following an event of default, the prospect of your payment is materially impaired).  We have the burden of establishing the impairment of such prospect of payment or performance.<br/><br/>‍<strong>Wisconsin Residents:</strong> We may declare you to be in default (a) if you permit to be outstanding an amount exceeding one full payment which has remained unpaid for more than 10 days after its scheduled due date or deferred due date, or if you fail to pay the first payment or last payment within 40 days of its scheduled due date or deferred due date or (b) if you fail to observe any other provision of this Agreement, the breach of which materially impairs your ability to pay the amounts due under the Agreement.<br/><br/>‍<strong>14. Remedies. </strong>In the event of your default under this Agreement, we may, subject to applicable law (including any applicable notice requirement): (a) declare all or any portion of your outstanding Account balance to be immediately due and payable; (b) instead allow you to repay your Account balance by paying the minimum payment due each billing cycle, without waiving any rights under subsection (a); and/or (c) commence a collection action against you and charge you for any court costs and/or any reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs we are charged in connection with such action by any attorney who is not our salaried employee. After a default, interest charges will continue to accrue until your total Account balance, including accrued interest charges, is paid in full, subject to applicable law.<br/><br/>‍<strong>15. Delay in Enforcement.</strong> We may at any time and in our sole discretion delay or waive enforcing any of our rights or remedies under this Agreement or under applicable law without losing any of those or any other rights or remedies. Even if we do not enforce our rights or remedies at any one time, we may enforce them at a later date. For example, we may accept late payments or payments that are marked “payment in full” or with other restrictive endorsements without losing any of our rights under this Agreement. <br/><br/>‍<strong>16. Servicer. </strong>Petal Card, Inc. (“Petal”), along with its partners and service providers, is the servicer of your Account and Card. In that capacity, Petal may act on our behalf, perform our obligations or enforce our rights under this Agreement.<strong><br/><br/>17. Communications and Call Recording. </strong>You authorize WebBank and Petal (one of WebBank’s service providers) and each of WebBank’s and/or Petal’s joint or independent affiliates, agents, assigns, and service providers (collectively, the “Messaging Parties”) to use automatic telephone dialing systems, artificial or prerecorded voice message systems, text messaging systems and automated email systems, or any system capable of storing and dialing telephone numbers to deliver messages relating to this Agreement, your Account, or your relationship with the Messaging Parties more generally (including but not limited to: messages about , upcoming Payment Due Dates, missed payments and returned payments) to any telephone number(s) you provide to the Messaging Parties. You also agree that these messages may deliver prerecorded and/or artificial voice messages. You understand that telephone messages may be played by a machine automatically when the telephone is answered, whether answered by you or someone else, and that these messages may also be recorded by your answering machine.  You also authorize the Messaging Parties to deliver messages to you via mail or email at any addresses you supply to them or that they obtain through any legal means.<br/><br/>You understand that anyone with access to your mail, telephone or email account may listen to or read the messages the Messaging Parties leave or send you, and you agree that the Messaging Parties will have no liability for anyone accessing such messages. You further understand that, when you receive a telephone call, text message or email, you may incur a charge from the company that provides you with telecommunications, wireless and/or internet services, and you agree that the Messaging Parties will have no liability for such charges except to the extent required by applicable law. You expressly authorize the Messaging Parties to monitor and record your calls with the Messaging Parties. If any telephone number you have provided to the Messaging Parties changes, or if you cease to be the owner, subscriber, or primary user of any such telephone number, you agree to immediately give notice to the Messaging Party who delivered the messages of such facts so that the Messaging Party can update its records.<br/><br/>This authorization is part of our bargain concerning this Agreement, and we do not intend it to be revocable. However, to the extent you have the right to revoke your consent to communications by autodialed calls and text messages to your mobile number under applicable law, you may exercise this right by contacting the applicable Messaging Party directly or by sending a request by email to support@petalcard.com with the subject line “END COMMUNICATIONS.” You may opt-out of receiving most of these messages at any time by sending us a request to support@petalcard.com or by responding “STOP” to any text message. To stop emails only, you can follow the opt-out instructions included at the bottom of the Messaging Parties’ emails. <br/><br/><strong>18.

As of the effective date, the changed terms, at our option, will apply to new purchases and the outstanding balances of your Account, to the extent permitted by applicable law.<br/><br/>‍<strong>35. Special Offers and Payment Plans. </strong>At our discretion, we may make special offers to you at any time. Such offers may apply to all purchases or balances on your Account, or only to some purchases or balances. We will provide to you the terms of any special offer and tell you how they differ from this Agreement. Except as provided in any special offer, the rest of this Agreement will still apply to your Account. These offers may include payment plans and skip payment offers. We may make special offers to certain cardholders and not others based on eligibility criteria established in our sole discretion. The availability of such an offer to certain cardholders shall not require that the offer be made available to all cardholders.<strong><br/><br/>36. Recurring Purchases. </strong>You may authorize a merchant to initiate purchases on a recurring basis to your Account. Upon the issuance by us of a new Card with a new Account number or expiration date, you may need to provide the merchant with such updated information in order to continue the recurring transactions.

Check Conversion Notification;</strong> Electronic Check Re-Presentment If you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your bank account or to process the payment as a check transaction.

In the event a check is returned unpaid for insufficient or uncollected funds, we may re-present the check electronically. <strong><br/><br/>38.  Foreign Currency Transactions.  </strong>If you make a transaction using your Account in a foreign currency (including, for example, online purchases from a merchant located outside of the U.S.), the credit card association will convert any transaction in foreign currency into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate for the applicable central processing date that is (1) selected by the association from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets, which rate may vary from the rate the association receives, or (2) the government mandated rate. The conversion rate you get may differ from the rate on the transaction date or the posting date, and from the rate that the credit card association gets. A merchant or other third party may convert a transaction into U.S. dollars or another currency, using a rate they select, before sending it to the credit card association.<strong><br/><br/>39.

You and we agree to comply with, and be bound by, this entire Agreement. You should retain and carefully review this entire Agreement, and sign your Card before using it. By completing your application for the Account (and unless you promptly reject the arbitration clause or are a “covered borrower” protected by the Military Lending Act), you agree to the Arbitration Clause even if you do not use the Account or the Card.<br/><br/><strong>2. Purchases</strong>. You may use your Account to purchase or lease goods or services (each, a “purchase”) by presenting your Card or providing to participating merchants and establishments that honor the Card your Card number and additional information by any other means (for example, over the phone, online or through a mobile app). We will not be liable to you (or anyone else) if any merchant or other person cannot or will not process a purchase permitted under this Agreement. Unless prohibited by applicable law, we may from time to time limit the type, number and dollar amount of any purchase, including any cash-like transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit to complete the purchase. Cash-like transactions include, but are not limited to, the following transactions to the extent they are accepted:</p><p>• purchasing travelers checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers, cryptocurrency, other similar digital or virtual currency and other similar transactions;</p><p>• purchasing lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers, and similar offline and online betting transactions;</p><p>• person-to-person money transfers and account-funding transactions that transfer currency; and</p><p>• making a payment using a third party service including bill payment transactions not made directly with the merchant or their service provider.</p><p>We reserve the right to deny any purchase for any reason, such as account default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling, or any indication of increased risk related to the purchase. We may terminate or suspend your use of the Card or the Account, with or without notice to you before or at the time we take such action. Cash advances and balance transfers are not available under this Agreement.<br/><br/><strong>3. Prohibited Uses of Account.</strong> You agree that you will only use the Account for personal, family and household purposes and will not use the Account for any unlawful purpose or for the purpose of paying us on this or any other form of credit account you may have with us. If you use your Card for any such purpose, we may declare you to be in default under this Agreement and we may block such transactions and/or terminate your Account, but you still will be liable to us for all charges relating to such transactions and all other transactions on your Account at the time it is closed. Further, you agree that you will not allow any other person to use the Card or Account without our consent. However, your breach of any of these promises will not affect or limit your liability to us with respect to your purchases. If you authorize or allow any person to use your Account, such authorization will be deemed to extend to all purchases by such person, even if not intended by you, and will continue until you have taken all steps necessary to prevent any further use of the Account by such person, even if you have advised us that such person is no longer authorized to use the Account. <br/><br/><strong>4. Promise to Pay  You promise to pay us for all amounts charged to the Account, including all purchases, interest, and charges charged to your Account.  You are obligated to repay us for all transactions made using your Card by people you have authorized to use the Card even if their use of the Card exceeds the authorization which you gave them.</strong><br/><br/><strong>5. Credit Limit; Available Credit. </strong>‍<br/>(a) We have disclosed your initial credit limit in your approval email. We will disclose your then-current credit limit and available credit on each monthly statement we send you. We may increase or decrease your credit limit at any time, on our own initiative or at your request (if we accept such requests). We may also close your Account or suspend your ability to use the Account at any time. We will provide any notice required by applicable law if we take any adverse action on your Account.<br/><br/>(b) At any time, your available credit equals the excess (if any) of your credit limit over your outstanding Account balance (including principal, fees and interest charges).  You agree not to attempt any purchase that exceeds your available credit. For purposes of determining your available credit, we do not give effect to any payment prior to the time we determine that the payment has been made with sufficient funds. Depending on your payment method, this may take up to 20 days.  We are not required to approve any purchase if the amount of the purchase exceeds your available credit but we may authorize and pay any such purchase in our absolute discretion. Whenever the outstanding balance of the Account exceeds your credit limit, you agree to pay us the difference on demand unless and to the extent that we have reduced your credit limit below your pre-existing balance prior to the reduction.<br/><br/><strong>6. Monthly Statements.</strong> We will send you a monthly statement shortly after the end of each monthly billing cycle with any activity, fee or interest charge or an ending debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00. However, we are not obligated to send you a monthly statement if we deem your Account to be uncollectible or applicable law does not require us to send you a monthly statement for other reasons. Your monthly statements will show, among other matters, the outstanding balance at the start and end of the billing cycle (that is, the “previous balance” and “new balance,” respectively); purchases; payments, credits and adjustments; interest charges and fees; your credit limit and available credit; and the minimum payment due and payment due date. <br/><br/><strong>7. Interest Charges.<br/><br/>‍</strong>(a) <em>General</em>. We use the “average daily balance (including new purchases)” method to calculate your interest charges. This means that, each billing cycle, we determine your interest charges by multiplying the average daily balance (which is shown on your monthly statements as the “balance subject to interest rate”) times the daily periodic rate and then by multiplying this amount by the number of days in the billing cycle.<br/><br/>(b) <em>Grace Period on Purchases</em>. <br/><br/>(i) If your Account balance is $0 at the beginning of a billing cycle or you pay the entire Account balance as of the beginning of a billing cycle by the payment due date that falls in such billing cycle, you get a “grace period” and will not be charged any interest charges for such billing cycle.<br/><br/>(ii) If you do not get a grace period for a billing cycle but you got a grace period for the immediately preceding billing cycle, we will not charge interest charges on purchases that were outstanding during such preceding billing cycle to the extent such purchases are paid by the payment due date that falls in the current billing cycle.<br/><br/>(iii) If you get a grace period on purchases for a billing cycle on account of a payment that is dishonored or reversed in the next billing cycle or a credit that is reversed in the next billing cycle due to the resolution of a billing dispute, we will charge you in the next billing cycle the interest charges you avoided in the prior billing cycle due to the dishonored or reversed payment or credit.<br/><br/> (c) <em>Interest Rates</em>. <br/><br/>(i) The daily periodic rate equals the APR divided by 365, rounded to the 6th decimal place.<br/><br/>(ii) The APR each billing cycle equals the sum of the Margin shown on your Customized Disclosures and the WSJ Prime Rate, determined as of the second business day (not weekends or federal holidays) of the same month in which your billing cycle closes (the “Determination Date”).  Accordingly, the APR (and daily periodic rate) may vary each billing cycle. The “WSJ Prime Rate” is the highest U.S. Prime Rate as published in the “Money Rates” section of <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> on the Determination Date (or if <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>does not publish such rate on such day, the latest prior day it does publish such rate). (If <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> stops publishing the U.S. Prime Rate in its “Money Rates” section, then we may substitute another index and margin, in our sole discretion, subject to applicable law.) An increase or decrease in the WSJ Prime Rate will cause a corresponding increase or decrease in the variable APR. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the APR and daily periodic rate will never exceed the maximum rates permitted by applicable law. <br/><br/>(iii) Unless you qualify for a grace period (see subsection (b)), if and when the variable APR increases, more interest charges will accrue. This will result in higher and/or more payments if you pay the minimum payment due each month. Unless you qualify for a grace period, if and when the variable APR decreases, less interest charges will accrue. This will result in lower and/or fewer payments if you pay the minimum payment due each month.<br/><br/>(d) <em>Balances Subject to Interest Rate</em>. <br/><br/>(i) The average daily balance (also known as the balance subject to interest rate) equals the sum of the closing daily Account balances for each day of the billing cycle, divided by the number of days in the billing cycle. <br/><br/>(ii) If you get a grace period for a billing cycle (see subsection (b)(i)), the Account balance is treated as $0 for each day in the billing cycle (and the average daily balance is $0). Otherwise, the closing balance for each day in the billing cycle is computed as follows: <br/><br/>(A) For each day (including the first day of the billing cycle), we start with the prior day’s closing balance, if any. <br/><br/>(B) For the first day of the billing cycle, if you received a grace period for the immediately preceding billing cycle, we deduct all payments and credits applied to purchases and posted by the payment due date that falls within the current billing cycle.<br/><br/>(C) For each day in the billing cycle (including the first day of the billing cycle), we add any new purchases posted to your Account, we add the interest charges from the prior day (the prior day’s closing balance times the daily periodic rate), add any fees charged that day, and subtract any payments or credits. However, we do not subtract a second time any payments or credits that have already been subtracted in step (B) above. (This method results in the daily compounding of interest charges.)<br/><br/>(D) We treat any negative daily balance as $0.<br/><br/>(e) <em>Interest Accrual Periods</em>. We charge interest charges over the following periods:<br/><br/>(i) If you get a grace period for the billing cycle in which the purchase is posted to the Account (the “Purchase Cycle”) and for the next billing cycle (the “Next Cycle”), we charge no interest charges at all.<br/><br/>(ii) If you get a grace period for the Purchase Cycle but not for the Next Cycle, we charge interest charges from the first day of the Next Cycle through the earlier of: (1) the day the purchase is repaid in full; or (2) the day before the beginning of the first billing cycle that comes after the Next Cycle and for which you get a grace period (the “Interest End Date”).<br/><br/>(iii) If you do not get a grace period for the Purchase Cycle, we charge interest charges from the day the purchase is posted to the Account through the Interest End Date.<br/><br/>8. Fees. Subject to applicable law, including the federal Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, you agree to pay the following fees: <br/><br/>(a) <em>Penalty fees</em>. <br/><br/>(i) Each time we do not receive the minimum payment due in full by the payment due date, we will charge you a late fee of $29.00 if we have not charged (or waived) a late fee within the six immediately preceding billing cycles.  However, we will charge a late fee of $40.00 if we have already charged (or waived) a late fee within the six immediately preceding billing cycles. We will never charge a late fee exceeding the minimum payment due that is late. <br/><br/>(ii) Each time a payment on your Account is returned or reversed for any reason or we must return any check or instrument you send us because it is not signed or is otherwise incomplete, we will charge you a returned payment fee of $29.00. However, we will not charge a returned payment fee if we are charging a late fee with respect to the same minimum payment due and will never charge a returned payment fee exceeding the minimum payment due that was due immediately prior to the date on which the payment was returned to us.<br/><br/>(b) <em>Additional fees</em>. We may charge fees for special services you request in accordance with applicable law.<br/><br/><strong>9. Limits on Interest, Fees and Charges. </strong>It is not our intent to charge or collect any interest, fee or charge in excess of the amount permitted by applicable law. If any interest, fee or charge is finally determined to be in excess of the amount permitted by applicable law, we will credit the excess amount against the outstanding balance in your Account or refund it to you.<br/><br/><strong>10. Payments. <br/><br/>‍</strong>(a) Each month, you must pay at least the minimum payment due shown on your monthly statement by the “cut-off time” on the payment due date shown on your monthly statement. The payment due date will be at least 25 days after the date of the monthly statement and will typically be on the same day of each calendar month. However, if the payment due date falls on a day we do not receive mail (a “non-business day”), we will not treat your payment by mail as late for any purpose if we receive it by the cut-off time on the next day we receive mail (a “business day”). The “cut-off time” is 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time for payments made online through the Petal Website or over the phone or 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time if you mail-in a payment by check or money order.<br/><br/>(b) If the new balance shown on your monthly statement for a billing cycle (the“Statement Cycle”) is less than $25.00, the minimum payment due in the next billing cycle equals such new balance. </p><p>Otherwise, the minimum payment due equals:</p><p>    • Any amount past due at the end of the Statement Cycle; plus</p><p>    • The greater of: </p><p>        (i) $25.00; or </p><p>        (ii) 1% of such new balance (excluding any interest charges, late fees, and any amount past due), plus interest charges for the Statement Cycle and any late fees.</p><p><br/>(c) You agree to make all payments in U.S. dollars in accordance with our instructions online on the Petal Website, by phone or by a check or money order drawn on a financial institution located in the U.S. All payments by check or money order must be mailed or delivered to us at the payment address shown on the front of your monthly statement. We reserve the right to refuse any non-conforming payments. Any payments received after the cut-off time on a business day or received on a non-business day will be credited on the next business day. However, credit to your Account may be delayed for up to five days if we accept a check or money order that is not: (i) received by mail or messenger service at the payment address on your monthly statement; or (ii) accompanied by the top portion of your monthly statement. Delayed crediting or our refusal of your non-conforming payment may cause you to incur additional fees and interest charges, subject to applicable law. <br/><br/>(d) Subject to applicable law, we may apply payments and other credits to your Account in any manner we choose in our sole discretion.  We will usually apply the minimum payment first to interest charges and then to balances. Although your minimum payment will be applied in any order at our discretion, payments in excess of the minimum payment will be applied to balances with the highest APR first and then to lower rate balances in descending order of APR. This means that balances with higher APRs are reduced before balances with lower APRs for any amount of your payment that is in excess of your minimum payment due. <br/><br/>(e) All credits for payments to your Card are subject to final payment by the institution on which the payment item was drawn. Depending upon the type of payment you make, your available credit may not be restored for up to 20 days after we receive a payment.<br/><br/>(f) You agree not to send us payments marked “paid in full,” “without recourse” or with similar language. If you send such a payment, we may accept it without losing any of our rights under this Agreement, including our right to collect the full amount owed by you. All written communications concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes “payment in full” of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, must be mailed or delivered to the Notice Address (as defined in Section 18), Attn: Disputed Payments. <br/><br/><strong>11. Prepayment. At any time, you may pay all or any part of your outstanding Account balance, without penalty.</strong> Payment of more than the minimum payment due in one billing cycle will not relieve you of the obligation to pay the entire minimum payment due in subsequent billing cycles.<br/><br/><strong>12. Termination. </strong>Subject to applicable law, we may suspend, revoke or cancel your Account privileges, your right to use the Card or deny any transaction, in our sole discretion at any time, with or without cause and with or without giving you notice.  Any termination of credit privileges, whether initiated by us or by you, will not affect any of our rights or your obligations under this Agreement, including your obligation to repay any amounts you owe us according to the terms of this Agreement. On our demand or upon termination of credit privileges, you agree to surrender to us or destroy the Card. If you attempt to use the Card after the termination of credit privileges (whether or not we have provided notice of such termination), the Card may be retained by a merchant, ATM or financial institution where you attempt to use the Card.<br/><br/><strong>13. Default.</strong> Subject to applicable law, we may declare you to be in default under this Agreement if: (a) you fail to pay any minimum payment due on or before the payment due date; (b) you attempt to or do exceed your credit limit; (c) you make a payment that is dishonored or reversed; (d) you die or are declared legally or mentally incompetent; (e) a petition is filed or other proceeding is commenced by or against you under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any other federal or state insolvency laws; (f) you become insolvent or unable to pay your debts; (g) you provide us with any false or misleading information; (h) you breach any of your other obligations under this Agreement; (i) you are in default of any other credit agreement you have with us or with Petal (as defined in Section 16); or (j) we have any reason to believe you are unwilling or unable to pay your debts.<br/><br/><strong>Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine and South Carolina Residents Only: </strong>We may declare you to be in default if you fail to make a payment as required by this Agreement (or within 10 days of the time required by this Agreement, for Iowa residents) or if the prospect of your payment or performance is significantly impaired (for Iowa residents, if, following an event of default, the prospect of your payment is materially impaired).  We have the burden of establishing the impairment of such prospect of payment or performance.<br/><br/>‍<strong>Wisconsin Residents:</strong> We may declare you to be in default (a) if you permit to be outstanding an amount exceeding one full payment which has remained unpaid for more than 10 days after its scheduled due date or deferred due date, or if you fail to pay the first payment or last payment within 40 days of its scheduled due date or deferred due date or (b) if you fail to observe any other provision of this Agreement, the breach of which materially impairs your ability to pay the amounts due under the Agreement.<br/><br/>‍<strong>14. Remedies. </strong>In the event of your default under this Agreement, we may, subject to applicable law (including any applicable notice requirement): (a) declare all or any portion of your outstanding Account balance to be immediately due and payable; (b) instead allow you to repay your Account balance by paying the minimum payment due each billing cycle, without waiving any rights under subsection (a); and/or (c) commence a collection action against you and charge you for any court costs and/or any reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs we are charged in connection with such action by any attorney who is not our salaried employee. After a default, interest charges will continue to accrue until your total Account balance, including accrued interest charges, is paid in full, subject to applicable law.<br/><br/>‍<strong>15. Delay in Enforcement.</strong> We may at any time and in our sole discretion delay or waive enforcing any of our rights or remedies under this Agreement or under applicable law without losing any of those or any other rights or remedies. Even if we do not enforce our rights or remedies at any one time, we may enforce them at a later date. For example, we may accept late payments or payments that are marked “payment in full” or with other restrictive endorsements without losing any of our rights under this Agreement. <br/><br/>‍<strong>16. Servicer. </strong>Petal Card, Inc. (“Petal”), along with its partners and service providers, is the servicer of your Account and Card. In that capacity, Petal may act on our behalf, perform our obligations or enforce our rights under this Agreement.<strong><br/><br/>17. Communications and Call Recording. </strong>You authorize WebBank and Petal (one of WebBank’s service providers) and each of WebBank’s and/or Petal’s joint or independent affiliates, agents, assigns, and service providers (collectively, the “Messaging Parties”) to use automatic telephone dialing systems, artificial or prerecorded voice message systems, text messaging systems and automated email systems, or any system capable of storing and dialing telephone numbers to deliver messages relating to this Agreement, your Account, or your relationship with the Messaging Parties more generally (including but not limited to: messages about , upcoming Payment Due Dates, missed payments and returned payments) to any telephone number(s) you provide to the Messaging Parties. You also agree that these messages may deliver prerecorded and/or artificial voice messages.

You further understand that, when you receive a telephone call, text message or email, you may incur a charge from the company that provides you with telecommunications, wireless and/or internet services, and you agree that the Messaging Parties will have no liability for such charges except to the extent required by applicable law. You expressly authorize the Messaging Parties to monitor and record your calls with the Messaging Parties. If any telephone number you have provided to the Messaging Parties changes, or if you cease to be the owner, subscriber, or primary user of any such telephone number, you agree to immediately give notice to the Messaging Party who delivered the messages of such facts so that the Messaging Party can update its records.<br/><br/>This authorization is part of our bargain concerning this Agreement, and we do not intend it to be revocable. However, to the extent you have the right to revoke your consent to communications by autodialed calls and text messages to your mobile number under applicable law, you may exercise this right by contacting the applicable Messaging Party directly or by sending a request by email to support@petalcard.com with the subject line “END COMMUNICATIONS.” You may opt-out of receiving most of these messages at any time by sending us a request to support@petalcard.com or by responding “STOP” to any text message.

Military Lending Act. </strong>Federal law provides important protections to members of the Armed Forces and their dependents (“Covered Borrowers”) relating to extensions of consumer credit.

As of the effective date, the changed terms, at our option, will apply to new purchases and the outstanding balances of your Account, to the extent permitted by applicable law.<br/><br/>‍<strong>35. Special Offers and Payment Plans. </strong>At our discretion, we may make special offers to you at any time. Such offers may apply to all purchases or balances on your Account, or only to some purchases or balances. We will provide to you the terms of any special offer and tell you how they differ from this Agreement. Except as provided in any special offer, the rest of this Agreement will still apply to your Account. These offers may include payment plans and skip payment offers. We may make special offers to certain cardholders and not others based on eligibility criteria established in our sole discretion. The availability of such an offer to certain cardholders shall not require that the offer be made available to all cardholders.<strong><br/><br/>36. Recurring Purchases. </strong>You may authorize a merchant to initiate purchases on a recurring basis to your Account. Upon the issuance by us of a new Card with a new Account number or expiration date, you may need to provide the merchant with such updated information in order to continue the recurring transactions. However, you authorize us to provide updated information to the merchant at our discretion. You must contact the merchant if you want to cancel automatic billing.<br/><br/>‍<strong>37. Check Conversion Notification;</strong> Electronic Check Re-Presentment If you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your bank account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic funds transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your bank account as soon as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. In the event a check is returned unpaid for insufficient or uncollected funds, we may re-present the check electronically. <strong><br/><br/>38.  Foreign Currency Transactions.  </strong>If you make a transaction using your Account in a foreign currency (including, for example, online purchases from a merchant located outside of the U.S.), the credit card association will convert any transaction in foreign currency into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate for the applicable central processing date that is (1) selected by the association from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets, which rate may vary from the rate the association receives, or (2) the government mandated rate. The conversion rate you get may differ from the rate on the transaction date or the posting date, and from the rate that the credit card association gets. A merchant or other third party may convert a transaction into U.S. dollars or another currency, using a rate they select, before sending it to the credit card association.<strong><br/><br/>39.

UNLESS YOU ARE A “COVERED BORROWER” PROTECTED BY THE MILITARY LENDING ACT (THE “MLA”) OR UNLESS YOU PROMPTLY REJECT THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE, IT WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT ON YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS PROCEEDING.<br/><br/>This Agreement governs the Petal 2 VISA® credit card account (“Account”) and related credit card (“Card”) provided by WebBank, located in Salt Lake City, Utah (the “Bank”). This Agreement includes the Important Disclosures we provided to you after approving you for the Account (the “Customized Disclosures”), the Arbitration Clause attached as Exhibit A, the Billing Error Rights Notice attached as Exhibit B, the State Notices attached as Exhibit C, your credit card application, and, as applicable, the Privacy Policy, and Risk-Based Pricing Disclosure. In this Agreement, the words “we,” “us,” and “our” mean the Bank, its successors and assigns, and, for purposes of the Arbitration Clause, the Related Parties identified in the Arbitration Clause. The words “you,” “your”, “yours” and “Cardholder” mean the person who applied for, received and accepted the Account from the Bank.<br/><br/><strong>1. Accepting this Agreement.</strong> This Agreement becomes effective and legally binding when you activate your Card by following the instructions on the Activation page of www.petalcard.com or a Petal mobile application (“Petal Website”). You and we agree to comply with, and be bound by, this entire Agreement. You should retain and carefully review this entire Agreement, and sign your Card before using it. By completing your application for the Account (and unless you promptly reject the Arbitration Clause or are a “covered borrower” protected by the Military Lending Act), you agree to the Arbitration Clause even if you do not use the Account or the Card.<br/><br/><strong>2. Purchases</strong>. You may use your Account to purchase or lease goods or services (each, a “purchase”) by presenting your Card or providing to participating merchants and establishments that honor the Card your Card number and additional information by any other means (for example, over the phone, online or through a mobile app). We will not be liable to you (or anyone else) if any merchant or other person cannot or will not process a purchase permitted under this Agreement. Unless prohibited by applicable law, we may from time to time limit the type, number and dollar amount of any purchase, including any cash-like transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit to complete the purchase. Cash-like transactions include, but are not limited to, the following transactions to the extent they are accepted:</p><p>• purchasing travelers checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers, cryptocurrency, other similar digital or virtual currency and other similar transactions;</p><p>• purchasing lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers, and similar offline and online betting transactions;</p><p>• person-to-person money transfers and account-funding transactions that transfer currency; and</p><p>• making a payment using a third party service including bill payment transactions not made directly with the merchant or their service provider.</p><p>We reserve the right to deny any purchase for any reason, such as account default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling, or any indication of increased risk related to the purchase. We may terminate or suspend your use of the Card or the Account, with or without notice to you before or at the time we take such action. Cash advances and balance transfers are not available under this Agreement.<br/><br/><strong>3. Prohibited Uses of Account.</strong> You agree that you will only use the Account for personal, family and household purposes and will not use the Account for any unlawful purpose or for the purpose of paying us on this or any other form of credit account you may have with us. If you use your Card for any such purpose, we may declare you to be in default under this Agreement and we may block such transactions and/or terminate your Account, but you still will be liable to us for all charges relating to such transactions and all other transactions on your Account at the time it is closed. Further, you agree that you will not allow any other person to use the Card or Account without our consent. However, your breach of any of these promises will not affect or limit your liability to us with respect to your purchases. If you authorize or allow any person to use your Account, such authorization will be deemed to extend to all purchases by such person, even if not intended by you, and will continue until you have taken all steps necessary to prevent any further use of the Account by such person, even if you have advised us that such person is no longer authorized to use the Account. <br/><br/><strong>4. Promise to Pay  You promise to pay us for all amounts charged to the Account, including all purchases, interest, and charges charged to your Account.  You are obligated to repay us for all transactions made using your Card by people you have authorized to use the Card even if their use of the Card exceeds the authorization which you gave them.</strong><br/><br/><strong>5. Credit Limit; Available Credit. </strong><br/><br/>(a) We have disclosed your initial credit limit in your approval email. We will disclose your then-current credit limit and available credit on each monthly statement we send you. We may increase or decrease your credit limit at any time, on our own initiative or at your request (if we accept such requests). We may also close your Account or suspend your ability to use the Account at any time. We will provide any notice required by applicable law if we take any adverse action on your Account.<br/><br/>(b) At any time, your available credit equals the excess (if any) of your credit limit over your outstanding Account balance (including principal, and interest charges).  You agree not to attempt any purchase that exceeds your available credit. For purposes of determining your available credit, we do not give effect to any payment prior to the time we determine that the payment has been made with sufficient funds. Depending on your payment method, this may take up to 20 days.  We are not required to approve any purchase if the amount of the purchase exceeds your available credit but we may authorize and pay any such purchase in our absolute discretion. Whenever the outstanding balance of the Account exceeds your credit limit, you agree to pay us the difference on demand unless and to the extent that we have reduced your credit limit below your pre-existing balance prior to the reduction.<br/><br/><strong>6. Monthly Statements.</strong> We will send you a monthly statement shortly after the end of each monthly billing cycle with any activity, fee or interest charge or an ending debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00. However, we are not obligated to send you a monthly statement if we deem your Account to be uncollectible or applicable law does not require us to send you a monthly statement for other reasons. Your monthly statements will show, among other matters, the outstanding balance at the start and end of the billing cycle (that is, the “previous balance” and “new balance,” respectively); purchases; payments, credits and adjustments; interest charges and fees; your credit limit and available credit; and the minimum payment due and payment due date. <br/><br/><strong>7. Interest Charges.<br/><br/>‍</strong>(a) <em>General</em>. We use the “average daily balance (including new purchases)” method to calculate your interest charges. This means that, each billing cycle, we determine your interest charges by multiplying the average daily balance (which is shown on your monthly statements as the “balance subject to interest rate”) times the daily periodic rate and then by multiplying this amount by the number of days in the billing cycle.<br/><br/>(b) <em>Grace Period on Purchases</em>. <br/><br/>(i) If your Account balance is $0 at the beginning of a billing cycle or you pay the entire Account balance as of the beginning of a billing cycle by the payment due date that falls in such billing cycle, you get a “grace period” and will not be charged any interest charges for such billing cycle.<br/><br/>(ii) If you do not get a grace period for a billing cycle but you got a grace period for the immediately preceding billing cycle, we will not charge interest charges on purchases that were outstanding during such preceding billing cycle to the extent such purchases are paid by the payment due date that falls in the current billing cycle.<br/><br/>(iii) If you get a grace period on purchases for a billing cycle on account of a payment that is dishonored or reversed in the next billing cycle or a credit that is reversed in the next billing cycle due to the resolution of a billing dispute, we will charge you in the next billing cycle the interest charges you avoided in the prior billing cycle due to the dishonored or reversed payment or credit.<br/><br/> (c) <em>Interest Rates</em>. <br/><br/>(i) The daily periodic rate equals the APR divided by 365, rounded to the 6th decimal place.<br/><br/>(ii) The APR each billing cycle equals the sum of the Margin shown on your Customized Disclosures and the WSJ Prime Rate, determined as of the second business day (not weekends or federal holidays) of the same month in which your billing cycle closes (the “Determination Date”).  Accordingly, the APR (and daily periodic rate) may vary each billing cycle. The “WSJ Prime Rate” is the highest U.S. Prime Rate as published in the “Money Rates” section of <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> on the Determination Date (or if <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>does not publish such rate on such day, the latest prior day it does publish such rate). (If <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> stops publishing the U.S. Prime Rate in its “Money Rates” section, then we may substitute another index and margin, in our sole discretion, subject to applicable law.) An increase or decrease in the WSJ Prime Rate will cause a corresponding increase or decrease in the variable APR. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the APR and daily periodic rate will never exceed the maximum rates permitted by applicable law. <br/><br/>(iii) Unless you qualify for a grace period (see subsection (b)), if and when the variable APR increases, more interest charges will accrue. This will result in higher and/or more payments if you pay the minimum payment due each month. Unless you qualify for a grace period, if and when the variable APR decreases, less interest charges will accrue. This will result in lower and/or fewer payments if you pay the minimum payment due each month.<br/><br/>(d) <em>Balances Subject to Interest Rate</em>. <br/><br/>(i) The average daily balance (also known as the balance subject to interest rate) equals the sum of the closing daily Account balances for each day of the billing cycle, divided by the number of days in the billing cycle. <br/><br/>(ii) If you get a grace period for a billing cycle (see subsection (b)(i)), the Account balance is treated as $0 for each day in the billing cycle (and the average daily balance is $0). Otherwise, the closing balance for each day in the billing cycle is computed as follows: <br/><br/>(A) For each day (including the first day of the billing cycle), we start with the prior day’s closing balance, if any. <br/><br/>(B) For the first day of the billing cycle, if you received a grace period for the immediately preceding billing cycle, we deduct all payments and credits applied to purchases and posted by the payment due date that falls within the current billing cycle.<br/><br/>(C) For each day in the billing cycle (including the first day of the billing cycle), we add any new purchases posted to your Account, we add the interest charges from the prior day (the prior day’s closing balance times the daily periodic rate) and subtract any payments or credits. However, we do not subtract a second time any payments or credits that have already been subtracted in step (B) above. (This method results in the daily compounding of interest charges.)<br/><br/>(D) We treat any negative daily balance as $0.<br/><br/>(e) <em>Interest Accrual Periods</em>. We charge interest charges over the following periods:<br/><br/>(i) If you get a grace period for the billing cycle in which the purchase is posted to the Account (the “Purchase Cycle”) and for the next billing cycle (the “Next Cycle”), we charge no interest charges at all.<br/><br/>(ii) If you get a grace period for the Purchase Cycle but not for the Next Cycle, we charge interest charges from the first day of the Next Cycle through the earlier of: (1) the day the purchase is repaid in full; or (2) the day before the beginning of the first billing cycle that comes after the Next Cycle and for which you get a grace period (the “Interest End Date”).<br/><br/>(iii) If you do not get a grace period for the Purchase Cycle, we charge interest charges from the day the purchase is posted to the Account through the Interest End Date.<br/><br/><strong>8. Fees. </strong>None<br/><br/><strong>9. Limits on Interest and Charges. </strong>It is not our intent to charge or collect any interest,  or charge in excess of the amount permitted by applicable law. If any interest, or charge is finally determined to be in excess of the amount permitted by applicable law, we will credit the excess amount against the outstanding balance in your Account or refund it to you.<br/><br/><strong>10. Payments. <br/><br/>‍</strong>(a) Each month, you must pay at least the minimum payment due shown on your monthly statement by the “cut-off time” on the payment due date shown on your monthly statement. The payment due date will be at least 25 days after the date of the monthly statement and will typically be on the same day of each calendar month. However, if the payment due date falls on a day we do not receive mail (a “non-business day”), we will not treat your payment by mail as late for any purpose if we receive it by the cut-off time on the next day we receive mail (a “business day”). The “cut-off time” is 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time for payments made online through the Petal Website or over the phone or 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time if you mail-in a payment by check or money order.<br/><br/>(b) If the new balance shown on your monthly statement for a billing cycle (the “Statement Cycle”) is less than $25.00, the minimum payment due in the next billing cycle equals such new balance. </p><p>Otherwise, the minimum payment due equals:</p><p>       • Any amount past due at the end of the Statement Cycle; plus</p><p>       • The greater of: </p><p>          (i)$25.00; or </p><p>          (ii) 1% of such new balance (excluding any interest charges and any amount past due), plus interest charges for the Statement Cycle.<br/><br/>(c) You agree to make all payments in U.S. dollars in accordance with our instructions online on the Petal Website, by phone or by a check or money order drawn on a financial institution located in the U.S. All payments by check or money order must be mailed or delivered to us at the payment address shown on the front of your monthly statement. We reserve the right to refuse any non-conforming payments. Any payments received after the cut-off time on a business day or received on a non-business day will be credited on the next business day. However, credit to your Account may be delayed for up to five days if we accept a check or money order that is not:(i) received by mail or messenger service at the payment address on your monthly statement; or (ii) accompanied by the top portion of your monthly statement. Delayed crediting or our refusal of your non-conforming payment may cause you to incur additional interest charges, subject to applicable law.<br/><br/>(d) Subject to applicable law, we may apply payments and other credits to your Account in any manner we choose in our sole discretion.  We will usually apply the minimum payment first to interest charges and then to balances. Although your minimum payment will be applied in any order at our discretion, payments in excess of the minimum payment will be applied to balances with the highest APR first and then to lower rate balances in descending order of APR. This means that balances with higher APRs are reduced before balances with lower APRs for any amount of your payment that is in excess of your minimum payment due. <br/><br/>(e) All credits for payments to your Card are subject to final payment by the institution on which the payment item was drawn. Depending upon the type of payment you make, your available credit may not be restored for up to 20 days after we receive a payment.<br/><br/>(f) You agree not to send us payments marked “paid in full,” “without recourse” or with similar language. If you send such a payment, we may accept it without losing any of our rights under this Agreement, including our right to collect the full amount owed by you. All written communications concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes “payment in full” of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, must be mailed or delivered to the Notice Address (as defined in Section 18), Attn: Disputed Payments. <br/><br/><strong>11. Prepayment. At any time, you may pay all or any part of your outstanding Account balance, without penalty.</strong> Payment of more than the minimum payment due in one billing cycle will not relieve you of the obligation to pay the entire minimum payment due in subsequent billing cycles.<br/><br/><strong>12. Termination. </strong>Subject to applicable law, we may suspend, revoke or cancel your Account privileges, your right to use the Card or deny any transaction, in our sole discretion at any time, with or without cause and with or without giving you notice.  Any termination of credit privileges, whether initiated by us or by you, will not affect any of our rights or your obligations under this Agreement, including your obligation to repay any amounts you owe us according to the terms of this Agreement. On our demand or upon termination of credit privileges, you agree to surrender to us or destroy the Card. If you attempt to use the Card after the termination of credit privileges (whether or not we have provided notice of such termination), the Card may be retained by a merchant, ATM or financial institution where you attempt to use the Card.<br/><br/><strong>13. Default.</strong> Subject to applicable law, we may declare you to be in default under this Agreement if: (a) you fail to pay any minimum payment due on or before the payment due date; (b) you attempt to or do exceed your credit limit; (c) you make a payment that is dishonored or reversed; (d) you die or are declared legally or mentally incompetent; (e) a petition is filed or other proceeding is commenced by or against you under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any other federal or state insolvency laws; (f) you become insolvent or unable to pay your debts; (g) you provide us with any false or misleading information; (h) you breach any of your other obligations under this Agreement; (i) you are in default of any other credit agreement you have with us or with Petal (as defined in Section 16); or (j) we have any reason to believe you are unwilling or unable to pay your debts.<br/><br/><strong>Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine and South Carolina Residents Only: </strong>We may declare you to be in default if you fail to make a payment as required by this Agreement (or within 10 days of the time required by this Agreement, for Iowa residents) or if the prospect of your payment or performance is significantly impaired (for Iowa residents, if, following an event of default, the prospect of your payment is materially impaired).  We have the burden of establishing the impairment of such prospect of payment or performance.<br/><br/>‍<strong>Wisconsin Residents:</strong> We may declare you to be in default (a) if you permit to be outstanding an amount exceeding one full payment which has remained unpaid for more than 10 days after its scheduled due date or deferred due date, or if you fail to pay the first payment or last payment within 40 days of its scheduled due date or deferred due date or (b) if you fail to observe any other provision of this Agreement, the breach of which materially impairs your ability to pay the amounts due under the Agreement.<br/><br/>‍<strong>14. Remedies. </strong>In the event of your default under this Agreement, we may, subject to applicable law (including any applicable notice requirement): (a) declare all or any portion of your outstanding Account balance to be immediately due and payable; (b) instead allow you to repay your Account balance by paying the minimum payment due each billing cycle, without waiving any rights under subsection (a); and/or (c) commence a collection action against you and charge you for any court costs and/or any reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs we are charged in connection with such action by any attorney who is not our salaried employee. After a default, interest charges will continue to accrue until your total Account balance, including accrued interest charges, is paid in full, subject to applicable law.<br/><br/>‍<strong>15. Delay in Enforcement.</strong> We may at any time and in our sole discretion delay or waive enforcing any of our rights or remedies under this Agreement or under applicable law without losing any of those or any other rights or remedies. Even if we do not enforce our rights or remedies at any one time, we may enforce them at a later date. For example, we may accept late payments or payments that are marked “payment in full” or with other restrictive endorsements without losing any of our rights under this Agreement. <br/><br/>‍<strong>16. Servicer. </strong>Petal Card, Inc. (“Petal”), along with its partners and service providers, is the servicer of your Account and Card. In that capacity, Petal may act on our behalf, perform our obligations or enforce our rights under this Agreement.<strong><br/><br/>17. Communications and Call Recording. </strong>You authorize WebBank and Petal (one of WebBank’s service providers) and each of WebBank’s and/or Petal’s joint or independent affiliates, agents, assigns, and service providers (collectively, the “Messaging Parties”) to use automatic telephone dialing systems, artificial or prerecorded voice message systems, text messaging systems and automated email systems, or any system capable of storing and dialing telephone numbers to deliver messages relating to this Agreement, your Account, or your relationship with the Messaging Parties more generally (including but not limited to: messages about , upcoming payment due dates, missed payments and returned payments) to any telephone number(s) you provide to the Messaging Parties. You also agree that these messages may deliver prerecorded and/or artificial voice messages. You understand that telephone messages may be played by a machine automatically when the telephone is answered, whether answered by you or someone else, and that these messages may also be recorded by your answering machine.  You also authorize the Messaging Parties to deliver messages to you via mail or email at any addresses you supply to them or that they obtain through any legal means.<br/><br/><br/>You understand that anyone with access to your mail, telephone or email account may listen to or read the messages the Messaging Parties leave or send you, and you agree that the Messaging Parties will have no liability for anyone accessing such messages. You further understand that, when you receive a telephone call, text message or email, you may incur a charge from the company that provides you with telecommunications, wireless and/or internet services, and you agree that the Messaging Parties will have no liability for such charges except to the extent required by applicable law.

You promise to keep login credentials up-to-date and to update the linked accounts on the Petal Website as login credentials change.

This rate must include, as applicable to the credit transaction or account, the costs associated with credit insurance premiums, fees for ancillary products sold in connection with the credit transaction, any application fee charged (other than certain application fees for specified credit transactions or accounts) and any participation fee charged (other than certain bona fide and participation fees for a credit card account). To hear disclosures related to the Military Lending Act, please call this toll-free number: 1-800-213-5794.</p><p>The Arbitration Clause of this Agreement does not apply to you if you are a Covered Borrower nor do any provisions of the Agreement that waive any right to legal recourse under any state or federal law to the extent required by the Military Lending Act.<br/><br/><strong>24.

YOU AND WE KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. THIS JURY TRIAL WAIVER SHALL NOT AFFECT OR BE INTERPRETED AS MODIFYING IN ANY FASHION THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE, WHICH CONTAINS ITS OWN SEPARATE JURY TRIAL WAIVER.<br/><br/>31. Entire Agreement. </strong>You acknowledge that this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Account and the Card. This Agreement supersedes and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous written or oral communication or understanding between you and us concerning the Account or the Card.

Change of Terms. </strong>Subject to applicable law, we may at any time change, add to or delete terms and conditions of this Agreement, including interest rates and this Change of Terms provision. Such changes may be based on our anti-fraud policies and procedures, your level of compliance with this Agreement, your credit score, other information contained in your credit report, prevailing economic conditions and/or any other factors. We will give you notice of any change, addition or deletion as required by applicable law. As of the effective date, the changed terms, at our option, will apply to new purchases and the outstanding balances of your Account, to the extent permitted by applicable law.<br/><br/>‍<strong>35. Special Offers and Payment Plans. </strong>At our discretion, we may make special offers to you at any time. Such offers may apply to all purchases or balances on your Account, or only to some purchases or balances. We will provide to you the terms of any special offer and tell you how they differ from this Agreement. Except as provided in any special offer, the rest of this Agreement will still apply to your Account. These offers may include payment plans and skip payment offers. We may make special offers to certain cardholders and not others based on eligibility criteria established in our sole discretion. The availability of such an offer to certain cardholders shall not require that the offer be made available to all cardholders.<strong><br/><br/>36. Recurring Purchases. </strong>You may authorize a merchant to initiate purchases on a recurring basis to your Account. Upon the issuance by us of a new Card with a new Account number or expiration date, you may need to provide the merchant with such updated information in order to continue the recurring transactions. However, you authorize us to provide updated information to the merchant at our discretion. You must contact the merchant if you want to cancel automatic billing.<br/><br/>‍<strong>37. Check Conversion Notification;</strong> Electronic Check Re-Presentment If you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your bank account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic funds transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your bank account as soon as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. In the event a check is returned unpaid for insufficient or uncollected funds, we may re-present the check electronically. <strong><br/><br/>38.  Foreign Currency Transactions.  </strong>If you make a transaction using your Account in a foreign currency (including, for example, online purchases from a merchant located outside of the U.S.), the credit card association will convert any transaction in foreign currency into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate for the applicable central processing date that is (1) selected by the association from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets, which rate may vary from the rate the association receives, or (2) the government mandated rate. The conversion rate you get may differ from the rate on the transaction date or the posting date, and from the rate that the credit card association gets. A merchant or other third party may convert a transaction into U.S. dollars or another currency, using a rate they select, before sending it to the credit card association.<strong><br/><br/>39.

Additionally, if we waive a particular obligation in one circumstance, it does not prevent us from subsequently requiring compliance with the obligation on other occasions.<br/><br/>‍</em>We reserve the right to remove any participant from the Program in the event of suspected fraud or abuse in connection with the Program Agreements.<br/><br/><strong>When and how you earn Cash Back Points.<br/><br/>1. <em>Petal Rewards</em></strong><em><br/><br/>‍</em>Through Petal Rewards, you will earn Cash Back Points on Eligible Purchases, which are defined as purchases, less credits for disputed charges, returns, transaction rebates, and other negative balance adjustments, made by you for your personal, family or household use, using your Petal 2 Card during the life of the Program.<br/><br/>The percentage of Cash Back Points earned is determined by the number of on-time payments made during the life of your Card Account and the dollar amount of Eligible Purchases made using your Petal 2 Card. Regardless of redemption method or the percentage earned, you may simply see “cash back,” “Available cash back balance,”“Petal Perks,” “rewards,” “Cash Back Wallet” or something similar in marketing and product materials when referring to the Cash Back Points you earned, may be eligible to earn, or which you may redeem. Details of the Program are described below. Petal Perks is provided by WebBank and is serviced by Petal Card, Inc. (collectively, “we,”“us,” or “our”).<br/><br/>Your Account will be given a Cash Back Points status of 1%, 1.25%, or 1.5% on Eligible Purchases (except for variations caused by rounding) in accordance with the following rules: <br/><br/>• Upon card activation, earn 1% Cash Back Points on Eligible Purchases;<br/><br/>• After six (6) on-time payments, earn 1.25% Cash Back Points on Eligible Purchases; and<br/><br/>• After twelve (12) on-time payments, earn 1.5% Cash Back Points on Eligible Purchases.<br/><br/>For the purpose of counting on-time payments, a payment is on-time when you have a statement balance greater than zero, and make at least the minimum payment listed on your periodic statement by the due date reflected on that statement and we are able to successfully process that payment. If you have made at least one purchase during the billing period and your balance for that billing period is equal to or less than zero, you will also receive credit for making an on-time payment. While you are able to make multiple payments per billing period, for the purpose of Petal Perks, you may accumulate only one on-time payment per billing period. If your Account is closed for any reason and you subsequently get a new Account, then on-time payments from your previous Account will not count towards the accumulation of on-time payments for your new Account.<br/><br/>Cash Back Points will be allocated based on the status tiers above. There is no minimum amount of Eligible Purchases required before earning Cash Back Points and no maximum limit on the amount of Cash Back Points you can earn over the life of your Card Account.<br/><br/>‍<em>Bonus Cash Back Points. </em>From time to time, bonus cash back points (“Bonus CashBack Points”) may be available on certain Eligible Purchases and may take the form of a higher percentage of Cash Back Points than the standard Cash Back Points status tiers or some other form of reward. Bonus Cash Back Points will be subject to theProgram Agreements as well as any other applicable terms and conditions associated with the Bonus Cash Back Points offer and may also be contingent upon your agreement with terms and conditions required by Third Party Service Providers. Bonus Cash Back Points may accrue and be available for redemption in the same manner as Cash Back Points. Petal will notify you of Bonus Cash Back Points opportunities if, and when, they are available.<br/><br/><strong>2. <em>Petal Offers<br/></em></strong><em><br/>‍</em>You will automatically be enrolled in Petal Offers, which are merchant-specific deals delivered through your account (each, an “Offer” or &quot;eligible purchase&quot;). You will earn Cash Back Points for purchase transactions that satisfy all the requirements specified in the terms of the individual Petal Offer (“Offer Terms”) and this Agreement. The amount of Cash Back Points you can earn as well as any additional terms and conditions of the Offer will be presented in the Offer Terms.<br/><br/>PetalOffers provides you with the benefit of receiving discounts with participating merchants on purchases made using your Petal 2 Card. We use a third-party card-linked offer provider, DOSH Holdings LLC (“DOSH”), as our service provider to help us operate Petal Offers. As a cardholder enrolled in Petal Offers, you authorize us, DOSH, participating merchants and Visa U.S.A (“Visa”) to use and share transaction details related to your Petal 2 Card in connection with providing you with discounts, credits and other services related to Petal Offers. Please review the DOSH Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. To see the current list of participating merchants and offers, please navigate to the Perks page of your Petal account online or in the app.<br/><br/>Discounts and credits through Petal Offers will not appear or be reflected on your transaction receipt from the merchant at the time of purchase, and will instead be applied to your Petal 2 Card Account as Cash Back Points.<br/><br/>‍<em>Other Types of Rewards. </em>Please note that your ability to earn rewards other than Petal Rewards or Petal Offers (such as Bonus Cash Back Points) based on spending may be based, in the case of eligible purchase transactions, on the charge after any statement credits have been applied. If an eligible transaction is subject to finance charges, such charges may accrue on the total amount of the eligible purchase transaction(s) prior to the application of any statement of credit, and the balance upon which such charges are assessed may include the gross amount of the eligible purchase transaction(s), from the date such transaction was made (i.e., without any savings from Petal Rewards or the Offer being applied). You will be responsible to pay amounts due as provided in the terms of your Petal 2 Credit Card Cardholder Agreement.<br/><br/>‍<em>Foreign Currency Transactions. </em>You can also benefit from Offers while traveling. When you make an eligible purchase transaction in a foreign currency, the amount of Cash Back Points earned will be determined using the exchange rate determined by the payment network (Visa).<br/><br/><strong>Transactions not eligible for Cash Back Points.</strong> Purchases for business or commercial use or any purchases prohibited by the Program Agreements are not eligible for Cash Back Points. Other purchases, including the following transactions, not eligible for CashBack Points include, but are not limited to:<br/><br/>• balance transfers, direct or indirect• cash advances, if applicable<br/><br/>• traveler’s checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers or similar cash-like transactions<br/><br/>• lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wages, or similar betting transactions</p><p>• purchases that are returned or otherwise credited to your Card Account</p><p>‍<br/>• interest and fees, if applicable• unauthorized or fraudulent charges• finance charges<br/><br/>• purchases of gift cards or pre-paid cards<br/><br/>• purchases of cash equivalents• person-to-person payments<br/><br/>Any Cash Back Points earned from ineligible purchases are subject to forfeiture and we reserve the right not to award Cash Back Points if, in our discretion, you abuse or attempt to abuse the Program Rules in any way.<br/><br/><strong>Transactions not eligible for Petal Offers. </strong>Not all transactions with your registered Petal 2 Card are eligible for Petal Offers. You acknowledge that Visa may be unable to monitor every transaction made with a Petal 2 Card which has been enrolled in Petal Offers, including but not limited to payments made through other payment methods(such as a digital wallet or a third party payment application, where you may choose your Petal 2 Card as a funding source but you do not present your card directly to the merchant), payments of existing balances, balance transfers, or transactions that are not processed or submitted through the Visa payment system, and that these transactions are not eligible for Petal Offers. <br/><br/><strong>When and how you can use your Cash Back Points. </strong>Cash Back Points earned during a billing period become available for redemption during the following billing period when they are added to your available Cash Back Points balance (“Available Cash Back Points”) or may be displayed as your “Cash Back Wallet.” We may round the amount of Cash Back Points earned from eligible purchase up or down in a manner determined in our sole discretion. For any given billing period, the amount of Cash BackPoints added to your balance is based on the net dollar amount of eligible purchases made during the previous billing period. If the net dollar amount of your eligible purchases is negative for a billing period, Cash Back Points will be deducted from your Available Cash Back Points/Cash Back Wallet and may result in a negative Available Cash Back balance/Cash Back Wallet. Note that while Cash Back Points earned fromPetal Offers during a billing period will typically become Available Cash Back/Cash Back Wallet Points during the following billing period, there may be delays.<br/><br/>You can redeem your Cash Back Points through an account statement credit, ACH transfer or by having a check mailed to the address on file with your Card Account. Once you request to redeem your Cash Back Points, you cannot cancel or otherwise revoke the request.We reserve the right to reject any redemption request if we cannot verify your identity or account information and we reserve the right to stop payment on any check redemption request should your account no longer be in Good Standing. <br/><br/><strong>Redemption for an account statement credit:<br/><br/>‍</strong>• Login to your online Card Account via Petal’s website or mobile application to request to redeem your Cash Back Points for a statement credit.<br/><br/>• While the statement credit will reduce your balance, you are still required to make at least your minimum payment each billing period.<br/><br/>• There is no minimum to the amount of Cash Back Points you are required to redeem in order to receive a statement credit.<br/><br/>• You may only redeem for a statement credit up to the amount of your current Petal 2 Card balance. That is, a statement credit redemption cannot result in your Petal 2 Card having a credit balance (that is, a balance less than zero). <br/><br/><strong>Redemption for a check:</strong><br/><br/>• Contact Petal Support by calling the number on the back of your card to request to redeem your Cash Back Points for a check.<br/><br/>• For Cash Back Points to be redeemed for a check, you must request to redeem CashBack Points in an amount equal to $20.00 or more.<br/><br/>• You can redeem for a check up to the amount of your Available Cash Back Points, which can be viewed by logging-in to your account on Petal’s mobile or web application.<br/><br/>• Checks will only be mailed to the address on file with your Card Account and will only be mailed within the United States, excluding U.S. territories.<br/><br/><strong>Redemption for ACH transfer:</strong><br/><br/>• Contact Petal Support by calling the number on the back of your card to request to redeem your Cash Back Points as an ACH transfer.<br/><br/>• You can redeem as an ACH transfer for up to the amount of your Available Cash Back Points, which can be viewed by logging-in to your account on Petal’s mobile or web application.  However, for Cash Back Points to be redeemed as an ACH transfer, you must request to redeem CashBack Points in an amount equal to $20.00 or more.<br/><br/>• ACH transfers will only be made to a valid US bank account where you are listed as a primary or joint account holder and that has already been linked to your Petal account.<br/><br/><strong>Cash Back Points accumulation limits. </strong>There is no annual or lifetime maximum on the amount of Cash Back Points you can earn.<br/><br/><strong>Cash Back Points duration and other terms.</strong> Earned Cash Back Points will not expire as long as your Card Account is open and remains in Good Standing. But, if your Card Account is closed for any reason, your participation in the Program will be terminated and you will lose any Available Cash Back Points you have not redeemed. Earned Cash Back Points are non-transferable and cannot be redeemed by anyone other than the Account holder. Additionally, Cash Back Points have no cash value and are not your property, until successfully redeemed. If you return, chargeback, cancel, dispute, or otherwise request a refund for a qualifying transaction for which you have already received Cash Back Points, we reserve the right to remove any related Cash Back Points from your Cash Back balance (which may result in a negative balance) or withhold future Cash BackPoints to cover any such amount.<br/><br/><strong>Other Important Information You Should Know<br/><br/>Cash Back Points Activity.</strong> Our processing platform serves as the final record of your Cash Back Points activity. This includes the amount of Cash Back Points you have available for redemption, the amount of Cash Back Points you’ve redeemed, and the percentage of Cash Back Points you will earn on qualifying transactions. In the event there is a discrepancy between your records and the processing platform, the information from the processing platform will be deemed correct.<br/><br/><strong>Audits.</strong> We reserve the right to audit the Accountholder’s Card Account for compliance with these Program Rules.

To receive confirmation of the debit transfer taking place, you may log into the Petal mobile application or website, or call your bank, or call Petal Customer Service at the number on the back of your Petal credit card.<br/><br/>1. Definitions:<br/><br/>A. Current Balance: The total amount of money you currently owe on your credit card, including your previous statement balance, any interest, past due amounts, fees (if applicable) and new charges made thereafter. Current Balance does not include any pending purchases at the time your AutoPay payment is withdrawn.<br/><br/>B. Statement Balance: The New Balance indicated on your most recent statement. Statement Balance does not include Charges This Month, payments, credits or disputes that have occurred between the statement issuance date and the AutoPay Date.<br/><br/>C. Minimum Payment Due: The payment amount required to keep your account in good standing, which will be indicated on your monthly statement. This amount will vary according to your balance each month and may be less than indicated on your statement as the result of adjustments or merchant credits.<br/><br/>D. Custom Amount: If you select the &quot;Custom Amount&quot; automatic payment option, your payment account will be debited for the dollar amount that you specified, except as provided herein. If the Custom Amount you have chosen is greater than the Current Balance on your Petal credit card account, then your account will be debited for no greater than the Current Balance on your account. However, you may have the option to turn-on/off a setting that allows your Custom Amount to be at least always equal to the amount of your Minimum Payment Due. You understand that each such debit will occur on the date specified in your payment notice and will occur no earlier than the payment schedule option you have selected.<br/><br/>E. AutoPay Bank Account: This is the bank account you have connected to your Petal account during enrollment into AutoPay.<br/><br/>F. AutoPay Date: This is the date you selected for us to begin processing your AutoPay Payment or shortly thereafter, and the same calendar day of each subsequent month (or the last day of the month if you selected the 29th, 30th, or 31st of any month without that many days) or shortly thereafter.<br/><br/>You agree that unless you notify us to stop or adjust the amount of the debit, in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph 4 below, you authorize the debit of funds from the AutoPay Bank Account in the amount specified in the automatic payment option you have selected on the AutoPay Date. You will ensure that there are sufficient funds in the AutoPay Bank Account on the specified debit date to pay the amount of the debit. For any automatic payment option you have selected, we are authorized to reduce the amount of the debit previously disclosed to you on your payment notice by the amount of any payments, credits applied (excluding purchase credits), or financial charges adjustments to your Petal credit card account prior to the scheduled debit date. You understand that if your Petal credit card account is cancelled and there is an outstanding balance on the credit card account, you authorize us to continue to automatically debit your AutoPay Bank Account unless you terminate participation in the Program in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph 6 below. If you close your AutoPay Bank Account, you agree to notify us beforehand to enable us to stop initiating debit transactions.<br/><br/>2. Additional Payments. If you would like to make payment in addition to the automated payment amount you have selected, you may do so by scheduling a one-time payment in-app, on the website, by phone or another means such as mailing in a check. Note, any additional payments made outside of your scheduled AutoPay payment amount will reduce the balance you owe toward your Minimum Payment Due, Statement Balance or Current Balance amounts. If you have scheduled your AutoPay to withdraw a Custom Amount, your withdrawal amount would only be modified if withdrawal of the original Custom Amount would result in a credit balance (e.g. -$100.00) to your Petal credit card account. Such modification to your Custom Amount in this instance, would result in a withdrawal that is no greater than your Current Balance amount.<br/><br/>3. Varying Amounts: You have the right to receive advance notice if any payment we seek will vary from the amount you authorize in your AutoPay settings or the previous debit. You authorize us to vary the amount of any payment so long as such payment is less than the pre-authorized amount for your Current Balance or, if you have selected the Current Balance AutoPay option, no greater than 110% of your maximum credit limit. We will send you a reminder at least ten (10) calendar days prior to initiating any debit by sending you an email that contains the details of your amount of your scheduled payment and the AutoPay Date. If your AutoPay Date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday or other day that we are not open for business, we will process your payment on the next available business day. However, the payment will be credited to your account as if it had been processed and posted on the AutoPay Date. All payments are subject to further verification and payment as well as the terms and conditions for your credit card and deposit accounts.<br/><br/>4.Stop Payment Orders/Adjustments: You may cancel your upcoming payment by turning off your AutoPay feature within the Petal Website and/or Mobile Application by no later than 8pm ET one (1) calendar day prior to your scheduled AutoPay Date. Also, you may edit your AutoPay settings on any date prior to your AutoPay Date, however, any changes you make after 8pm ET one (1) calendar day prior to your scheduled AutoPay Date will occur after your payment processes and will be effective for the following month’s AutoPay Date.<br/><br/>You must update your Petal account: (a) if any information changes regarding your bank account, (b) if you wish to change the account or financial institution from which your payment is debited, <strong>or</strong> (c) if you wish to stop a payment or discontinue your participation in AutoPay.<br/><br/>5. Returned Payments: If your AutoPay Bank Account rejects your payment because of insufficient (NSF) or uncollected funds, you authorize Petal to reinitiate the payment up to as many times as is permitted by applicable ACH network rules and applicable law, without further notice to you. However, you agree that we are under no obligation to reinitiate any rejected debits. At our discretion, we may attempt to process the charge again within 14 days. If funds are not fully available at any time during your participation in the Program, or your account is otherwise not in good standing, we reserve the right to terminate your participation therein. If your account is unenrolled for any reason, you will receive an email alert notifying you that your account has been unenrolled. You may incur and be responsible for returned payment fee(s), if applicable to your Petal credit card account type, as well as any such fees charged by your bank.<br/><br/>6. Termination of Participation in the Program: You may turn off or edit the AutoPay settings at any time by going to the ‘Settings’ page on your online account and changing your payment preferences. This is the exclusive means by which you may revoke this authorization.<br/><br/></p><p>‍</p></div></div><div id="petal-one-time-online-payment-terms-and-conditions" class="rich-div"><div class="w-richtext"><p><strong>Petal One-Time Online Payment Terms and Conditions<br/></strong></p><p><strong>Last Modified:</strong> September 16, 2020</p><p><strong>CONSENT TO ELECTRONIC WITHDRAWAL</strong></p><p>You authorize Petal, as the servicer for your Petal credit card, and any successive servicer (together “we” or “us”) to initiate an automated clearing house (ACH) debit in your name from the financial account you specified and in the U.S. Dollar amount you requested through the Petal application of Petal’s website, on or soon after the payment date you specified.

This notification affects these Terms of Use only; if you previously entered into other arbitration agreements with us or enter into other such agreements in the future, your notification that you are opting out of the arbitration provision in these Terms of Use shall not affect the other arbitration agreements between you and us.</p><p><strong>c. Severability.</strong> If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.</p><p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p><p>These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent. All waivers and modifications must be in a writing signed by Petal, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms of Use, and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. The section and paragraph headings in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and shall not affect their interpretation. Any use of “including” “for example” or “such as” in these Terms of Use shall be read as being followed by “without limitation” where appropriate. To the extent permitted by law, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any other similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</p><p><strong>Contact</strong></p><p>You may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@petalcard.com?subject=Hello">support@petalcard.com</a></p></div></div><div id="petal-card-terms-of-use-for-a-digital-wallet" class="rich-div"><div class="w-richtext"><p><strong>Petal Card Terms of Use for a Digital Wallet<br/></strong></p><p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 06, 2019<br/><strong>Last Revised:</strong> August 21, 2020</p><p>These Petal Card Terms of Use for a Digital Wallet (the “Terms”) apply when you add a Petal credit card account (“Petal Card”) to an electronic wallet or other third-party digital payment service (“Digital Wallet”). They are an agreement between you, the person to whom the Petal Card was issued, and WebBank, Member FDIC (“we”, “us,” and “our”) and apply to you and anyone else you authorize to use your Petal Card through your Digital Wallet (collectively, “you” and “your”). Your Petal Card is serviced by Petal Card, Inc.<br/></p><p><strong>If you do not agree to these Terms, do not add your Petal Card to, or use your Petal Card in connection with, a Digital Wallet. </strong>We reserve the right to change these Terms, including adding other eligibility criteria for participation in our Digital Wallet services, at any time and without notice as permitted by law, and your continued use of a Digital Wallet constitutes agreement to all such changes.<br/></p><p>By adding your Petal Card to a Digital Wallet, you accept and agree to the following:</p><p>1. Adding your Petal Card. You can add an eligible Petal Card to a supported Digital Wallet by following the instructions of the Digital Wallet provider. For certain Digital Wallets, you may also see alternative instructions on Petal’s proprietary platform (e.g., Petal mobile app or petalcard.com). During registration, you may be required to take additional steps to authenticate yourself before your Petal Card is added to a Digital Wallet, such as providing additional identifying or verifying information. When adding your card to a Digital Wallet, a Digital Wallet Provider may add a unique identifier different from your Card number (“Device Account Number”) to your Digital Wallet that enables you to make purchases through that Digital Wallet.<br/><br/>If your Petal Card is not in good standing or your account is frozen for any reason, then your Petal Card will not be eligible to be added to any Digital Wallet and if already in a Digital Wallet, the card may be deactivated or removed. When you add a Petal Card to the Digital Wallet, you may use the Digital Wallet to transact with retailers who support that Digital Wallet. Note though, a Digital Wallet may not be accepted everywhere where your Petal Card is accepted.<br/></p><p>2. Terms that Apply. In addition to these Terms, you agree that when you use a Digital Wallet, you will remain subject to the terms and conditions of all your existing agreements with us, your mobile service carrier (e.g., AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, etc.), and your Digital Wallet Provider (e.g., Apple, Google, Samsung, etc.). These Terms do not amend or supersede any of those agreements, including but not limited to, your Petal Visa Credit Card Cardholder Agreement (“Cardholder Agreement”), disclosures agreed to as part of opening your Petal card (including, as applicable, the Privacy Policies, Truth in Lending Disclosure, and Risk-Based Pricing Disclosure), and the Arbitration Agreement included in your Cardholder Agreement.<br/><br/>Any applicable interest, fees, and charges that apply to your Petal Card or underlying account will also apply when you use a Digital Wallet to make purchases with your Petal Card. We currently do not charge any additional fees for adding your Petal Card to a Digital Wallet, but we reserve the right to impose a fee in the future.<br/><br/>You understand that a Digital Wallet provider, or another third-party supporting a Digital Wallet provider, may however charge a fee or impose certain restrictions or limitations for using your Petal Card in a Digital Wallet. You agree that you are solely responsible for compliance with such agreements.<br/></p><p>3. Third-Party Disputes. You understand and agree that we are not a Digital Wallet provider and therefore, are not responsible for the products and services associated with a Digital Wallet. Accordingly, you agree to resolve any disputes directly with the Digital Wallet provider or third-party service provider (such as your mobile service carrier) without involving us. Such disputes may include, but are not limited to, payment failures caused by the Digital Wallet and errors or delays caused by or the inability to use the Digital Wallet for a transaction. We are not responsible for the security, accuracy, legality, appropriateness or any other aspect of the content or function of the Digital Wallet or any third party’s products or services.<br/></p><p>4. Notifications. You consent to us and/or the Digital Wallet provider sending you notifications through the Digital Wallet from time to time reflecting your Petal Card account activity and/or marketing messages. If you do not wish to receive notifications, you may turn them off through your device’s settings or by the procedures established by the Digital Wallet provider.<br/></p><p>5. Transaction History. The transaction history displayed in a Digital Wallet is for illustrative purposes only and may be preliminary and/or incomplete. You understand and agree the transaction amount that ultimately clears, settles, and posts to your Petal Card’s monthly statement serves as the final record, even if it does not match the details of the Digital Wallet provider’s transaction history.<br/></p><p>6. Lost, Stolen or Unauthorized Use of your Eligible Device or Card. Some Digital Wallets can only be used with a compatible device determined by the Digital Wallet Provider for that Digital Wallet (“Eligible Device”). Devices modified contrary to the manufacturer’s software or hardware guidelines, including by disabling hardware or software controls—sometimes referred to as “jailbreaking”—are not Eligible Devices. You acknowledge that the use of a modified device to use your Petal Card in connection with a Digital Wallet is expressly prohibited, constitutes a violation of these Terms, and is grounds for us to deny you access to your Petal Card through a Digital Wallet(s).<br/><br/>If you believe your Eligible Device or your credentials have been lost, stolen or otherwise compromised, or someone has used or may use your Eligible Device or your credentials without your authorization, you must call us immediately at the number on the back of your Petal Card. Additionally, please refer to and follow the instructions provided by the Digital Wallet provider. If you fail to notify us without delay, you may be liable for part or all the losses in connection with any unauthorized use of your Petal Card in connection with that Digital Wallet<br/><br/>If your physical Petal Card is lost or stolen, but your Eligible Device is not lost or stolen, the information on the newly reissued card may be automatically assigned to your existing Device Account Number. Due to the way a Digital Wallet operates, you may need to present your Eligible Device to a merchant when you return an item purchased using that Digital Wallet on such Eligible Device. So, for example, if you make a purchase using your Apple Wallet on your iPhone, the merchant may require you to have that same iPhone present to return the item.<br/></p><p>7. Suspension/Removal of Your Petal Card. We reserve the right to discontinue offering or supporting Digital Wallet services at any time for any reason. Unauthorized use of a Digital Wallet, including, but not limited to, unauthorized entry into our systems, misuse of passwords or misuse of other information, is strictly prohibited and will result in suspension and/or termination of your use of a Digital Wallet. We reserve the right to block, restrict, suspend, or terminate your use of any Digital Wallet at any time without notice for any reason, including if you violate these Terms or any other agreements with us, except as otherwise required by applicable law. You agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any suspension, cancellation or termination of your use of a Digital Wallet.<br/><br/>For instructions on how to remove your Petal Card from a Digital Wallet, contact the Digital Wallet provider.<br/></p><p>8. Authorization to Collect and Share Data. You agree that we may collect, transmit, store, and use technical, location, log in, or other information about you or your use of your Petal Card through a Digital Wallet. You also acknowledge that we may share certain details of your Petal Card Digital Wallet transactions with the Digital Wallet provider, merchants, a payment network, and others in order to provide the services you have requested, to make information available to you about your Petal Card transactions, and to improve our ability to offer these services. This information helps us to add your Petal Card to the Digital Wallet and to maintain the Digital Wallet services.<br/></p><p>9. Privacy. We will use, share, and protect your personal information in accordance with the Petal Card, Inc. General Privacy Policy. We do not control the privacy and security of your information that may be held by the Digital Wallet provider. You acknowledge that the use and disclosure of any personal information provided by you directly to a Digital Wallet provider, payment network, or other third parties supporting that Digital Wallet, will be governed by such party’s privacy policy and not the Petal Card General Privacy Policy.  <br/></p><p>10. Electronic Communications. You agree to receive electronic communications and disclosures, including automatically dialed calls or text messages, from us on your devices at the number you provide. You also agree that we can contact you by email at any email address you provide to us in connection with any Petal product, service or account, or through the mobile device on which you have downloaded the<strong> </strong>Petal Mobile app. It may include contact from companies working on our behalf to service your accounts. You agree to update your contact information with us when it changes. If at any time you revoke this consent, we may suspend or cancel your ability to use your Petal Card in connection with a Digital Wallet.   <br/></p><p>11. Merchant Relationships and Disclaimers. Merchants may offer you certain discounts, rebates or other benefits (e.g. free shipping) (“Offers”) in a Digital Wallet. Such Offers are subject to certain terms and conditions and may change at any time without notice to you. We will not be liable for any loss or damage as a result of any interaction between you and a merchant with respect to such Offers. Subject to applicable law and your Cardholder Agreement, all matters, including delivery of goods and services, returns, and warranties, are solely between you and the applicable merchants. You acknowledge that we do not endorse or warrant the merchants that are accessible through a Digital Wallet or the Offers they provide.<br/><br/>12. Ending or Changing these Terms; Assignments. We can add to, delete portions of, or terminate these Terms at any time without notice to you, except where required by law. Your use of a Petal Card in a Digital Wallet after we have made such changes available will be considered your agreement to the changes. We can also assign these Terms. Furthermore, subject to applicable law, at any time we may (i) terminate your use of any Petal Card in connection with a Digital Wallet, (ii) modify or suspend the type or dollar amounts of transactions allowed using Petal Cards in connection with a Digital Wallet, (iii) change the Petal Card’s eligibility for use with a Digital Wallet and/or (iv) change the Petal Card authentication process. You cannot change these terms, but you can terminate these Terms at any time by removing your Petal Card from any Digital Wallets. You may not assign these Terms.<br/><br/>13. Governing Law. These Terms are governed by federal law and, to the extent that state law applies, the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. Disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms will be subject to the Arbitration Agreement in your Cardholder Agreement.<br/><br/>14. Indemnification. You agree to indemnify and hold us, our licensors, sponsors, agencies, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of (i) your use of a Digital Wallet service or (ii) any breach of the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms by you or other users of your Petal Card or Digital Wallet credentials. You must use your best efforts to cooperate with us in the prosecution or defense of any such claim. We reserve the right to employ counsel of our choice to defend and control any such matter subject to indemnification by you. You have the right, at your own expense, to employ separate counsel to participate in such matter on a non-controlling basis.<br/><br/>As provided in the Cardholder Agreement, you are responsible for all uses of your Petal Card account by third parties you gave access to, including if these third parties misuse your Petal Card or any Digital Wallet services.<br/><br/>15. Limitation of Liability; No Warranties. WE ARE NOT AND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY OR FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL<strong> </strong>DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR ADDING YOUR PETAL CARD TO A DIGITAL WALLET, OR YOUR ACCESS OR USE OF A DIGITAL WALLET. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND (EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS) AS TO ANY AND ALL DIGITAL WALLETS AND ALL INFORMATION, PRODUCTS AND OTHER CONTENT INCLUDED IN OR ACCESSIBLE FROM THE DIGITAL WALLETS.<br/><br/>16. Questions. If you have any questions, disputes, or complaints about the Digital Wallet, contact the Digital Wallet provider using the information given to you by the provider. If your question, dispute, or complaint is about your Petal Card, then contact Petal Card support by emailing support@petalcard.com or calling the number on the back for your card.<br/><br/>The Petal Card is issued by WebBank, Member FDIC.</p></div></div><div id="refer-a-friend-program-terms" class="rich-div"><div class="w-richtext"><p><strong>PETAL CARD<br/>REFER A FRIEND PROGRAM TERMS<br/></strong></p><p>The “Refer a Friend” Program (the &quot;Program&quot;) is a promotional referral program offered by Petal Card, Inc. (&quot;Petal&quot;) where existing Petal cardmembers may be rewarded for referring individuals to Petal subject to the terms and conditions stated herein (the &quot;Program Terms&quot;). To qualify for the Reward (as defined below), referred individuals must be approved for a Petal Card account in accordance with these Program Terms.  By choosing to participate in the Program, you are accepting and agreeing to these Program Terms. These Program Terms form an agreement between you and Petal with respect to the Program. You should read these Program Terms carefully.

ELIGIBILITY<br/><br/>The Program is open to all Petal cardholders in good standing (as defined herein) who are legal residents of the fifty (50) United States and the District of Columbia.  The Program is void elsewhere and where prohibited.  You may only refer individuals who have never had a Petal card account and who have never been issued a Petal card as an additional cardholder. Employees of Petal, WebBank or either of their affiliates are not eligible to participate in the Program and may not be referred through the Program. <br/><br/>2. OFFER REQUIREMENTS <br/><br/>Each offer provided through the Program (“Offer”) will include specific Offer Terms that describe the relevant reward (“Reward”) and eligibility requirements for redeeming the Offer and receiving the Reward.  Petal may provide multiple Offers at any given time.

Rewards will only be issued to Petal card accounts that are in good standing  and not in default.  Your account is in <strong>“Good Standing”</strong> as long as you fully comply with these Program Terms, your Petal 1 or 2 Visa Credit Card Cardholder Agreement as may be amended from time to time (“Cardholder Agreement”), <a href="legal#petal-perks-program-rules">Petal Perks Program Rules</a>, disclosures agreed to as part of opening your Petal card (including, as applicable, the <a href="legal#general-privacy-policy">Privacy Policies</a>, Truth in Lending Disclosure, and Risk-Based Pricing Disclosure) and Arbitration Agreement (collectively, the “Program Agreements”).  For an avoidance of doubt, an account in good standing for purposes of this Program includes, but is not limited to an account for which all required opening documentation has been completed and verified, and is not locked, or restricted, or otherwise flagged in any way.  If the Referrer’s account is closed or not in good standing for any reason at any time, any cash back Rewards awarded hereunder will be forfeited.    <br/><br/>5. MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION OF PROGRAM<br/><br/>The Program is offered at the discretion of Petal, and Petal reserves the right to terminate, suspend, or modify the Program, Program Terms, Offer Terms, Rewards, conditions of participation, or any other aspect of the Program, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without notice; however, such changes will not affect any Rewards already earned.  <br/><br/>6. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES    <br/><br/>By participating in this Program, you agree that Petal and its agents, representatives, affiliates, and employees will have no liability whatsoever for any injuries, losses, claims, damages or any special, exemplary, punitive, indirect, incidental or consequential damages of any kind, whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, resulting from your participation in the Program or receipt or use of any Reward, any failure or delay by Petal in connection with the Program, or the performance or non-performance of the Program by Petal, even if Petal has been advised of the possibility of damages.  This disclaimer of liability applies to any damages or injury caused by any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation, computer virus, communications line failure, theft or destruction, or unauthorized access to, alteration of, or use of your information.          <br/><br/>Petal makes no warranty of any kind regarding the Program or any Reward, which are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis.  Petal expressly disclaims all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and those arising by statute or otherwise in law or from a course of dealing or usage of trade.  Petal is not responsible or liable for any warranty, representation, or guarantee, express or implied, in fact or in law, relative to the Program or any Reward, including without limitation that the Program will be error-free, or as to the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of any content or information distributed with respect to the Program.  Some states do not allow the limitation of liability and disclaimer of implied warranties, so the disclaimers and limitations above may not apply to you. 7.             <br/><br/>ADDITIONAL TERMS <br/><br/>Information collected from you will be used in accordance with the Petal’s<a href="privacy-policy"> Privacy Policy</a>. <br/><br/>These Program Terms, in conjunction with the relevant Offer Terms, make up the entire agreement between you and Petal relating to the Program, and replace any prior understandings or agreements (whether oral or written) regarding the Program.
