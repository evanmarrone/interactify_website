Upon any change in these Terms of Use we will post the amended agreement on the Services; we may also attempt to notify you in some other way.

We work with one or more Third Party Services (as defined below) that will securely store pursuant to industry standards any Authorized Bank Account access credentials that you provide on the Services and will access your Authorized Bank Accounts for the purposes of providing and improving the services we offer on the Services. You may only provide account access credentials for and authorize us to access valid accounts that you hold in your own name. You may not provide access credentials for an account that is held by a third person. You must update your Account information to reflect any change to the username or password that is associated with any Authorized Bank Account.<br/><br/>If you choose to link your Authorized Bank Account, you authorize the use of this information to provide you with Petal Services.

You further understand that, when you receive a telephone call, text message or email, you may incur a charge from the company that provides you with telecommunications, wireless and/or internet services, and you agree that Petal will have no liability for such charges except to the extent required by applicable law. To stop text messages, you can also simply reply “STOP” to any text message Petal sends you. To stop text message related to fraud, you must call us at 1-855-697-3825. To stop emails, you can follow the opt-out instructions included at the bottom of the emails Petal sends you; if an email does not include these instructions, it is a transactional or relationship message and you cannot opt out of receiving it in the future.</p><p><strong>Third Party Sites and Services</strong></p><p>The Services may permit you to link to, use or otherwise access other websites, services or resources (“Third Party Services”), and other websites, services or resources may contain links to the Services.

ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER. </strong>YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US OR OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR EMPLOYEES IN THEIR CAPACITY AS SUCH (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STREAMLINED ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES OF JAMS, INC. THEN IN EFFECT, AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT (I) ANY DISPUTE RELATED TO YOUR USE OF A PETAL VISA™ CREDIT CARD IS GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF THE CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT, AND (II) TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE IN ANY MANNER VIOLATED OR THREATENED TO VIOLATE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WE MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. AS AN ALTERNATIVE, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIM IN YOUR LOCAL “SMALL CLAIMS” COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT&#x27;S RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION, UNLESS SUCH ACTION IS TRANSFERRED, REMOVED OR APPEALED TO A DIFFERENT COURT. YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS ONLY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF. NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION FOR ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event JAMS, Inc. is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the American Arbitration Association. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Services or these Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever banned.<strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>b. 30-Day Opt-Out Period. </strong>If you do not wish to be bound by the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions in this section, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of the date that you first accept these Terms of Use (unless a longer period is required by applicable law). Your written notification must be mailed to us at the following address: Petal Card, Inc., MSC – 166931, P.O Box 105168, Atlanta, GA 30348-5168 ATTN: Legal. If you do not notify us in accordance with this section, you agree to be bound by the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions of these Terms of Use, including such provisions in any Terms of Use revised after the date of your first acceptance. Such notification must include: (i) your name; (ii) your email and mailing addresses and (iii) a statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration. If we make any changes to the Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section of these Terms of Use (other than a change to the address at which we will receive notices of dispute, opt-out notices, or rejections of future changes to the Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the address set forth in this section. This notification affects these Terms of Use only; if you previously entered into other arbitration agreements with us or enter into other such agreements in the future, your notification that you are opting out of the arbitration provision in these Terms of Use shall not affect the other arbitration agreements between you and us.</p><p><strong>c. Severability.</strong> If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.</p><p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p><p>These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent. All waivers and modifications must be in a writing signed by Petal, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms of Use, and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. The section and paragraph headings in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and shall not affect their interpretation. Any use of “including” “for example” or “such as” in these Terms of Use shall be read as being followed by “without limitation” where appropriate. To the extent permitted by law, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any other similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</p><p><strong>Contact</strong></p><p>You may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@petalcard.com?subject=Hello">support@petalcard.com</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="footer wf-section"><div class="container w-container"><div class="w-layout-grid footer-grid"><div id="w-node-_55f27e73-61b2-3966-18a6-f1fcae5bc09a-ae5bc097"><div class="footer-column-header">Build Credit</div><a href="petal-1" class="footer-links">Petal 1</a><a href="petal-2" class="footer-links">Petal 2</a><a href="the-app" class="footer-links">App</a></div><div id="w-node-_55f27e73-61b2-3966-18a6-f1fcae5bc0a3-ae5bc097"><div class="footer-column-header">Company</div><a href="the-company" class="footer-links">Company</a><a href="careers" class="footer-links">Careers</a><a href="reviews" class="footer-links">Reviews</a></div><div id="w-node-_55f27e73-61b2-3966-18a6-f1fcae5bc0ac-ae5bc097"><div class="footer-column-header">Resources</div><a href="blog" class="footer-links">Blog</a><a href="https://support.petalcard.com/" target="_blank" class="footer-links">Help Center</a><a href="contact" class="footer-links">Contact Us</a></div><div id="w-node-_55f27e73-61b2-3966-18a6-f1fcae5bc0b5-ae5bc097" class="footer-right-side-div"><div class="footer-get-app"><div class="footer-column-header">Get the Petal App</div><div class="footer-app-store-div"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/petal-safe-simple-credit/id1400353064?mt=8" target="_blank" class="app-store-link w-inline-block"><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/636a6f81a287f5628189d717/6376530eca820d0ff8ddab33_Badge_Apple%20store.svg" loading="lazy" alt="Apple App Store Button"/></a><div class="_16px-separator"></div><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.petalcard.petal&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" class="app-store-link w-inline-block"><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/636a6f81a287f5628189d717/6376530e30c9255f4bfc5b30_Badge_GooglePlay.svg" loading="lazy" alt="Google Play Store Button"/></a></div><div class="mobile-tiny-text">Google Play and the Google Play logo are trademarks of Google, Inc.
